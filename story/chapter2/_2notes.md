# Chapter 2 - Notes

- Story: ./chapter2.md (current location)

## Authorial Intent

### Theme: Bittersweet Wonder
This chapter balances trauma with Pokémon fan wish-fulfillment. The first Pokémon encounter is intentionally complicated—exciting but disappointing, wonderful but heartbreaking. This sets the emotional tone that Pokémon being "real" doesn't mean they're automatically cuddly companions.

### Dr. Fuji Control Beats (Subtle)
Reader should notice red flags that Amber excuses:
- Dress obsession while bleeding ("he's just stressed")
- Commands not requests ("Get changed and go to sleep")
- Answers for her, steers her physically
- Leaves Ditto as guard without explanation

Amber rationalizes everything as grief/exhaustion/protective father behavior. She has no frame of reference for abuse yet.

### Ditto's Arc Setup
Ditto maintains distance not because of orders alone, but because it's a **lab Pokémon** that's never experienced companionship. It doesn't know what play is, what affection means, or how to bond. The progression Ch2→Ch3 is Ditto learning socialization for the first time.

Amber interprets this through a Pokémon fan lens: "It's shy like a real animal with boundaries." Doesn't realize Ditto is learning what a partner even is.

### Tonal Goals
- Ground the fantasy with body horror (child body, throwing up, everything too high)
- Show trauma response (bile taste lingering, exhaustion)
- Give one moment of pure wonder (touching Ditto's warmth and texture)
- End on emotional ambiguity ("wonderful or heartbreaking")
