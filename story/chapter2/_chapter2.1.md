# [Chapter 2] All Aboard!

The convenience store's fluorescent lights buzzed overhead, casting everything in that particular shade of artificial white that made 2 AM feel even more surreal. Dr. Fuji had spotted it a few blocks from where we'd emerged into the city---one of those 24-hour places that seemed to exist in a temporal pocket, serving tourists who'd forgotten essentials and insomniacs who'd given up on sleep.

The girl behind the counter was maybe sixteen, slouched over a magazine with her chin propped on one hand. The door chimed and she glanced up with annoyance.

Her spine straightened, magazine sagging in loose fingers as she took in Dr. Fuji's torn, bloodstained shirt and me wrapped in my lab coat disaster burrito. Her eyes went wide, mouth opening slightly.

For about two seconds, her expression cycled through something that looked like concern, then confusion, then a very deliberate return to her magazine. Problem solved via strategic blindness. Honestly couldn't blame her.

Dr. Fuji limped past without acknowledgment, moving through the aisles directly towards the medical supply section.

Dr. Fuji limped past without acknowledgment. Medical supplies first - an entire wall of them. Different grades of bandages, burn cream, antiseptic sorted by brand, painkillers arranged by strength. He grabbed what he needed for his wounds, added bottled water and pre-packaged sandwiches that looked like they'd been there since Cinnabar's last newsworthy eruption. 

Then he stopped at the clothing rack. His hand hovered over an oversized Psyduck tee, pulled back, reached for a different one. Held it up against me, frowning.

"Do you have dresses? Ideally a white dress?" he called toward the counter. "For a child?"

The girl's head lifted slowly from her magazine. She stared at him, then glanced around at the racks of tourist tees and cheap flip-flops. At the energy drinks. At the industrial bags of chips.

"Sir, this is a convenience store," she said, her voice flat.

Dr. Fuji's jaw tightened into a frown. He turned back to the rack, pulling out the yellow Psyduck shirt with more force than necessary. "This will have to do," he muttered, measuring it against me again. Added swim trunks that might work as shorts, grabbed a plain button-down for himself.

"$28.47."

Fuji produced bills from his wallet, slightly rumpled. The checkout happened in near silence besides the ring of the register.

Three blocks inland, Dr. Fuji found a small hotel. Its "vacancy" sign hung slightly crooked outside. Glass doors separated the lobby from the rest of the building, but was locked. It didn't seem to be that fancy, but clean enough.

Dr. Fuji pressed the buzzer.

We waited. Thirty seconds. A minute. After two minutes, Dr. Fuji pressed it again.

A door behind the empty desk opened and a man emergedâ€”mid-forties, hair flattened on one side from a pillow. He crossed the lobby and unlocked the door.

"Flame Forest, right?" The man loudly mused as he turned his back to us to slowly walk back to the lobby counter. He wasn't really looking at us. "Everyone comes for the hot springs and figures they'll check out the wilderness while they're here. Maybe find a Fire Stone, catch a rare Vulpix. But those Skarmory nest in the canopy and they're very territorial. Those wings will---"

He stopped as he turned around to get a good look at us.

"You brought a kid there?" His voice sharpened. "Sir, Flame Forest isn't a casual stroll. Those Skarmory don't care how old---"

"We didn't go to Flame Forest." Fuji brushed past him and pulled out his wallet. "My patience is wearing thin. Just give me a room for the night."

The clerk stood there, mouth curled into a deep frown. His gaze moved from Fuji's bloodstained collar to me wrapped in the lab coat, then down to the bag in Fuji's other hand---medical supplies visible through the thin plastic.

The man's shoulders sagged as he stepped back behind the counter to pull out a worn ledger. "I get it. Medical bills are insane, especially for people. I constantly see trainers overestimating themselves in these parts and I just want to make sure you are okay."

"Just give me a room for the night," Dr. Fuji said as he tapped a finger against the counter.

The man sighed, "$120 for a single room, $140 for a twin room."

Dr. Fuji thought for a moment before pulling out his money and sliding it across the counter, "Single."

The man nodded in confirmation. "Name? And I'll need to see some ID."

Dr. Fuji pulled out a license and slid it across the counter.

The man picked it up to examine it for a moment before nodding. "Okay. Mr. Fuji... your room is on the second floor, room 202. And here's the key. Check out at 11am."

Dr. Fuji snatched the key and quickly pulled me along behind him, not bothering to thank the man.

"The Pokemon Center is Southeast of here, if you need it," the man quietly shouted after we left.
