# [Chapter 2] All Aboard!

"It doesn't look right," Dr. Fuji murmured the moment I exited the bathroom.

"You're the one that picked these..." I argued back as I tugged at the tag scratching my neck.

I shuddered as I remembered the clothes Dr. Fuji had brought me. An oversized Psyduck tee-shirt, pants dragging on the ground over flip-flops. I looked ridiculous, but weirdly appropriate for a child my size.

"What was that?" Dr. Fuji asked, his voice filled with surprise. He narrowed his eyes at me, then shook his head, murmuring something to himself.

After a moment of awkward silence, he stretched out his hand and commanded, "Come here."

I paused to debate if I should take his hand but it ultimately felt too weird to me. I shook my head and said, "Let's just go."

Dr. Fuji coldly stared at me and repeated, "Take my hand."

I shuddered at his gaze and slowly took his hand.

Dr. Fuji gripped my hand tightly as he guided me just a bit too fast. I felt my feet drag behind me as he pulled me along.

We walked past the big resort hotels at the edge of town, then into the smaller tourist center where families wandered between souvenir shops and cafes.

A Meowth lounged in a shop window, lazily batting at a display of postcards while its trainer arranged souvenirs. A Machop hefted boxes from a delivery truck, working alongside its trainer who was checking items off a clipboard. A family walked past, their daughter about my new size with a young Pidgey perched contentedly on her shoulder, the two of them sharing what looked like a berry-flavored ice pop.

I could have that too now, couldn't I? Not the Rattata—but my own Pokemon partner, someone to grow with, to train with...

This wasn't some game or show anymore—these were real, living Pokemon, going about their daily lives just like I'd always dreamed.

My thoughts wandered to what I could achieve in this world, especially with all this meta knowledge.

My thoughts scattered as we rounded a corner and the small terminal station came into view.

A sign adorned the building's entrance: "GAMMA SHUTTLE" in crisp red letters, with a stylized Pidgeot logo. Inside, a few ceiling fans spun lazily overhead wafting the scent of coffee. A handful of people scattered across rows of wooden benches, most of them in suits.

Dr. Fuji stepped to the open counter and immediately asked, "Express to Celadon---when is the next flight?"

The clerk scanned something behind her counter. "You two have a good trip in Cinnabar?" she asked, making small talk. She looked up briefly to smile at the two of us.

Dr. Fuji grunted and nodded.

The clerk looked up again and frowned at Dr. Fuji's lack of response then looked back at me, her eyes lingering for a few seconds before she put her head back down to scan behind her counter again.

After a few more moment, the clerk shook her head. With an apologetic smile, she said, "I'm sorry, but the next flight in an hour is already fully booked. You might have to wait for the next one. That one is scheduled in..."

The clerk paused for a moment to scan something behind her counter again, "tomorrow at 7 AM."

Dr. Fuji frowned. "We need to get to Celadon as soon as possible. Find a way to get us on the next flight."

The clerk sighed and pushed back her chair. "I'll go ask." She disappeared into the back leaving us to wait silently.

A few minutes later, the clerk returned and nodded, "We'll be able to get you a Fearow. Is that acceptable?"

Dr. Fuji nodded. "Yes, a Fearow will do."

The clerk's gaze lingered on me for a few seconds before she looked back at Dr. Fuji. "I am obliged to warn you. This Fearow is more... aggressive than your average Pidgeot. The flight may not be pleasant, especially for children." She then glanced at Dr. Fuji. "Is that alright?"

Dr. Fuji glanced down at me.

I shrugged, "I should be fine." Inwardly I was just giddy with excitement at the thought of flying any Pokemon.

Dr. Fuji shook his head, "No, you will not be fine." He then looked at the clerk. "Any way to get a Pidgeot instead? I'll pay extra."

The clerk shook her head, "I'm sorry, but the Pidgeot are already fully booked."

Dr. Fuji frowned as he looked around. "By who?"

The clerk awkwardly shook her head, "I don't think it's company policy to give you that---"

Before the clerk could finish, Dr. Fuji left the counter towards one of the businessmen. After a somewhat long back and forth, and exchange of pleasantries, Dr. Fuji and the man both walked up to the counter.

"I'll agree to take the Fearow," the businessman said to the clerk with all smiles. "What do I need to do?"

The clerk sighed and nodded, "Okay, I think you just have to buy the ticket and then you can just swap Pokemon during the flight. The captains likely wouldn't need to know."

The businessman nodded, "We'll do that." He then crouched down to my level, "You must be Amber, right?"

I nodded.

"It's nice to meet you, Amber." The businessman smiled warmly as he stood back up. He then looked at Dr. Fuji, "To protect the world from devestation."

Dr. Fuji nodded back, "To unite all peoples within our nation."

I looked between the two of them. That motto was very familiar...

The businessman left, leaving the clerk and Dr. Fuji to exchange a few more words.

"Okay, That'll be... ₽220,000 total, ₽110,000 each."

Dr. Fuji nodded and exchanged the black metal credit card with the clipboard. After filling out the necessary information, he handed the clipboard back to the clerk.

Soon after handing the clipboard back, a ticket and a receipt were printed out. The clerk handed both the credit card and the receipt back to Dr. Fuji and the tickets to Dr. Fuji.

"Okay, you all should be good to go now, Mr. Fuji, enjoy your flight," the clerk said as she handed the tickets to Dr. Fuji. Then she looked at me with a bright smile, "Enjoy your flight as well, Amber."

Dr. Fuji nodded and grabbed the tickets and my arm, pulling us away without even thanking the clerk.
