# Chapter 2 - Summary

Immediate aftermath of the Mewtwo escape. Dr. Fuji takes Amber to a convenience store and then a hotel in Cinnabar. Amber throws up from trauma and showers to clean off blood and grime. When she emerges, Dr. Fuji is gone and Ditto has been left to watch her. Amber is excited to encounter her first real Pokemon, touches Ditto briefly, but Ditto maintains distance and won't let her play. She falls asleep disappointed but clinging to the thought: "I touched a real Pokemon."

- Story: [Chapter 2](./chapter2.md)

## What happens:
### 1. Seeking Refuge:
*   Dr. Fuji, injured and with Amber, finds a 24-hour convenience store. A skeptical teen clerk observes their disheveled state.
*   Fuji buys medical supplies, food, and clothes for Amber, settling on a Psyduck t-shirt and swim trunks after failing to find a dress.
*   They proceed to a small hotel, where the night clerk, concerned by their injuries, mistakes their situation for a dangerous outing in Flame Forest. Fuji secures a single room for the night.

### 2. Confronting Reality and Trauma:
*   In the hotel room, Fuji attends to his wounds. Amber, realizing she's covered in grime and Fuji's blood, is overwhelmed by nausea and vomits.
*   She then showers, cleansing herself of the physical remnants of the lab and her old life, and notes her new child-like body and mint-green hair.

### 3. First Encounter and Disappointment:
*   Upon exiting the bathroom, Amber finds Dr. Fuji gone, replaced by a Ditto sitting near the door, acting as a guard.
*   Overwhelmed with excitement, Amber attempts to interact with the Ditto, achieving a brief, warm touch.
*   The Ditto, however, maintains its distance, refusing to engage in play.
*   Amber falls asleep, disappointed by the lack of playful interaction, but deeply impacted by the reality of having touched a real Pokemon.

## Potential speculation:
*   **Fuji's Paternal Instincts:** Dr. Fuji's insistence on finding a dress for Amber, despite their dire circumstances, could symbolize his desperate attempt to restore normalcy and an idealized image of his lost daughter, contrasting sharply with the scientific and violent reality of her creation.
*   **World Awareness:** The clerks' reactions, particularly the assumption of a Flame Forest incident, highlight the common dangers and the established social norms of the Pokemon world, foreshadowing the challenges Amber and Fuji will face in integrating or concealing their true situation.
*   **Ditto's Role:** Fuji's decision to leave Amber with Ditto, despite his own injuries, suggests a deep trust in the Pokemon's protective capabilities or indicates a pre-programmed directive, implying Ditto is more than just a wild Pokemon and has a specific purpose in guarding Amber.
*   **Amber's Identity Struggle:** Amber's conflicting emotions—excitement over Ditto juxtaposed with the trauma of her rebirth and the strangeness of her new body—underscore her ongoing internal struggle to reconcile her past adult consciousness with her present childlike identity in this new world.
*   **Economic Realities:** The emphasis on the cost of supplies and the hotel room subtly reinforces the economic realities of this Pokemon world, suggesting that survival and resource acquisition will be practical challenges for Amber as she embarks on her journey.
