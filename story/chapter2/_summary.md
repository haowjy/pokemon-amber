# Chapter 2 - Summary

Immediate aftermath of the Mewtwo escape. Dr. Fuji takes Amber to a convenience store and then a hotel in Cinnabar. Amber throws up from trauma and showers to clean off blood and grime. When she emerges, Dr. Fuji is gone and Ditto has been left to watch her. Amber is excited to encounter her first real Pokemon, touches Ditto briefly, but Ditto maintains distance and won't let her play. She falls asleep disappointed but clinging to the thought: "I touched a real Pokemon."
