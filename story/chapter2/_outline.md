# Chapter 2 — Outline (Beach-first)

Goal: Immediate cut to wonder while laying subtle control cues. Avoid heavy self-loathing; one concrete death-echo only. No nudity; start in ill-fitting gift‑shop clothes. Tickets at a beachside airfield kiosk (not the Pokémon Center). End with flight awe. Aligns with Dr. Fuji’s control arc.

## Sequence A — Dawn on the Beach (Smash cut)
1. Smash cut: salt air, cool sand, pale light. MC clocks a surreal fact: I’m in the Pokémon world.
2. Minimal death-echo (choose one line, keep it single):
   - “If I let go, I might not wake up here.”
   - “The crosswalk’s red hand would still be blinking if this were a game.”
3. Clothes: ill‑fitting tourist tee + shorts + sandals (gift‑shop). MC notes the wrongness in silhouette/fit.
4. Fuji grumbles (quiet, to himself): “These don’t feel right… We’ll find your old dresses.”
   - Subtext: replication impulse/control.
5. Fuji’s micro‑behaviors: double‑checks bracelet/strap; hand at shoulder guides MC’s path (protective/herding).

## Sequence B — Beach Airfield (Tickets + Lax Security)
6. Small open‑air ticket kiosk by the dunes; mix of operators: Pokémon flyers (Pidgeot/Fearow/Noctowl) and hot‑air balloon pilots.
   - Airport vibe, minimal bureaucracy; handwritten manifests, whistle codes.
   - Pricing board: Pokémon flights cheaper than balloons; balloons marketed as “scenic.” (Amber continuity.)
7. Lax security beat: clerk does a quick visual check, ignores lack of Amber’s ID; “She’s with you? You’re good.” Fuji signs.
   - Fuji steers the conversation; declines news chatter; pays exact.
8. Staff line seed: “Express is forming up at the east beach.” Transition back to beach.

## Sequence C — Beach Assembly (Light character color)
9. Passengers gather: contest pair, harried exec, excited kid. One‑line sketches; light humor.
10. Lin/Reed arrival; Ampharos does faux–flight‑attendant beats.
11. MC’s restrained squee; focus on tactile noticing (feathers, wind, salt) over meta.

## Sequence D — Pidgeot Express (Awe set‑piece)
12. Formation arrives (whistle, wing‑rush). Keep descriptive awe heavy; ~70% wonder / 30% undercurrent.
13. Safety briefing; MC’s nerves resolve into excitement.
14. Fuji double strap‑check; voice calm; hands perhaps a little too steady.

## Sequence E — Ascent (Release + micro‑unease)
15. Takeoff: sky opens; ocean like glass; color and wind beats.
16. MC dozes mid‑flight (earned calm). Fuji’s too‑long look; careful strap adjustment.
17. Button image: “The island rotated away beneath us.”

## Foreshadowing Cues (subtle, deniable)
- Clothes: “not right” → old dresses (control motif seed).
- Physical adjustments: bracelet/straps repeated 2–3×.
- Gated info: declines news; brisk schedule; steers forms.
- Hand on shoulder guiding path; locked case can be a background prop later if needed.

## Trim/Remove From Current Draft
- Long self‑recrimination cluster → compress to one death‑echo line.
- Multi‑paragraph canon branching → one sentence elsewhere, or cut entirely here.
- “Sleep is dangerous” abstraction → omit in this variant.

## Notes
- No nudity. We start clothed via gift‑shop stop between Ch1’s rescue and this dawn.
- Ditto: optional off‑page mention here; save on‑page behavior for later chapters unless you want a one‑line cameo.
