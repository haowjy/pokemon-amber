# Chapter 2 — Outline

Goal: Wonder‑first with grounded infrastructure; subtle control cues; no exposition. Start in ill‑fitting gift‑shop clothes; ticket at a small Cinnabar airfield terminal (no blimps; Cinnabar mass transit is boats but not visible here; airfield is trainers + Express). End on flight awe.

## Chapter goals
- Worldbuilding: terminal; boats + Pokemon flights;
- Dr. Fuji: control with dark hints (answers for MC, "family business," premium card, declines news, too‑long look aloft).
- Captains: introduce Captain Lin (lead) and Captain Reed (wing); Ampharos safety assist.
- Danger: brief wild Pokemon incursion on entourage; Magneton response justifies security.

## Story beats (big scenes)

### Story beat 1: Ticketing, Waiting Room, Window (Cinnabar terminal)
- Fuji asks: "Express to Celadon — when and how much?" Clerk surprised; goes to check on radio (might not have space). Returns: can fit two today; last‑minute fare is ₽100,000. Fuji pays immediately with a black metal credit card.
- Waiting area: hushed business chatter. Overheard: fire in the northwest, a rich man’s mansion, forest line lit. MC connects it to Mewtwo.
- Control cues (dark hint): Fuji answers for MC; intercepts wandering with a gentle but firm “Where are you going?”; redirects her to sit, then escorts to the window on his timing.

### Story beat 2: Arrival Set‑Piece (awe‑first)
- A whistle cuts the dawn—three sharp notes. Wind holds its breath; wing‑pressure in ribs. Formation breaks the bright: eight Pidgeot; Fearow on the wing; Noctowl a silent shadow. MC’s “holy shit” release.
- Sensory anchors: salt/feather scent; crests catching light like flame; wingbeats turning air into architecture.
- Captains: Lin leads; Reed rides wing; Ampharos present as understated safety.
- Reed’s Fearow cry scatters sleeping Wingull; awe continues without interruption.
- Quick sorting to birds; camera stays tight for MC’s first feather touch starting Beat 3.

### Story beat 3: Curiosity vs Control (mount + shutdown)
- Lin engages the child amid suits.
- MC: "Why is there a Magneton here?" (curious, looking at the escort unit with the team.)
- Fuji interrupts: answers technically in place of Lin (perimeter/approach, charge equalization), adds "Please focus on your harness"; inserts "Family business" to shut context.
- Lin starts to get talkative (first time? Celadon home or visit? saw the smoke?)—Fuji answers for MC or redirects.
- Control cues: gentle but firm hand on shoulder; physically steers MC; checks buckles that don’t need checking; pays without looking at the price board.
- Harnessing begins; first strap mention here. No sleep beat.
- Takeoff flows directly into awe established in Beat 2.
