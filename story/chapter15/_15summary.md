# Chapter 15 - Summary

Electabuzz stands between Amber and Ash and Dr. Fuji's Magmar as a home invasion erupts into a deadly street fight; Amber rejects Fuji as Professor Oak arrives.

- Story: [Chapter 15](./chapter15.md)

## What happens:
### 1. The invasion ignites:
*   Magmar blows in the front door; Electabuzz shields Amber and Ash as fire and smoke spread through the house.
*   Electabuzz cuts through Magmar's Fire Spin to keep the kids alive while Amber and Ash crawl toward the kitchen exit.

### 2. Battle spills outside:
*   Electabuzz lunges into the yard; Thunder Punch clashes with Fire Punch amid Smog and crackling arcs of electricity.
*   Poison Jab lands on Electabuzz; even so, Electabuzz hammers Magmar into Fuji's car.

### 3. A tragic fall:
*   A point‑blank Fire Blast slams Electabuzz back into the house; after a defiant resurgence, Electabuzz is pinned and then incinerated.
*   Officer Jenny arrives but her Growlithe is swiftly overwhelmed by Magmar.

### 4. Defiance and arrival:
*   Amber, holding a sobbing Ash, tells Fuji she is not his daughter; Fuji spirals, fixated on "family."
*   Dragonite lands with Professor Oak, setting up the showdown.

## Potential speculation:
*   **Ash's trauma and resolve:** Witnessing Electabuzz's death may harden Ash's drive to train and protect others.
*   **Legal fallout:** Fuji's public violence in Pallet likely triggers swift League and law‑enforcement action.
*   **Ditto's agency:** Prior hesitation and "protocol" commands imply conditioning that Ditto may be struggling to resist.
*   **Oak's role:** Oak's timing and confidence foreshadow a high‑level engagement revealing his true battle pedigree.
