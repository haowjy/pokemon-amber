# Chapter 3 - Notes

- Story: ../chapter3.md

## Intent
- Establish Amber's restlessness and desire for adventure
- Show Ditto training and bonding with Amber
- Set up Amber's escape to explore Celadon City

## Beats
- Amber struggles with wearing dresses (body dysphoria)
- Ditto attempts to copy Amber in dress, fails hilariously with cartoon legs
- Training montage: Ditto learns to transform into Pokémon and objects from TV
  - Transforms into lamp, TV, Poliwrath, various Pokémon
- Amber watches Pokémon battles on TV, gets inspired
- A few days later: Amber waits for Dr. Fuji to leave, then escapes apartment
- **Ditto goes into Poké Ball initially** (Amber doesn't know city rules)
- On street: sees Pokémon everywhere, releases Ditto
- **Ditto autonomously drapes around neck** "like a living scarf" (own initiative, no prompting)
- Amber explores city, finds transit station with map
- Heads toward Celadon Gym

## Continuity
### Ditto Form Progression
- **Training:** Learns various transformations including Pokémon and objects from commercials
- **Leaving apartment:** In Poké Ball (cautious about rules)
- **On street:** Released, autonomously drapes around shoulders "like a living scarf"
  - NOTE: Not actually transformed into fabric - just positioned scarf-like as pink blob
  - Warm, comfortable weight around neck
  - From distance looks like oddly purple scarf
- **Through city:** Remains draped around neck
- Leads into Chapter 4 where Ditto starts in this position

### Licensing/Rules
- Amber doesn't know Pokémon licensing rules yet
- Sees other trainers with Pokémon on belts/properly contained
- Scarf form works as unintentional camouflage

## Foreshadowing
- Ditto's intelligence and initiative (choosing scarf form without prompting)
- Amber's Pokémon battle knowledge from 15+ years of gaming
- License/permit system mentioned (will be important in Ch5)

## Open Questions
- Will anyone recognize Ditto's unusual abilities?
- How long until Dr. Fuji notices she's gone?

## To-Do
- None
