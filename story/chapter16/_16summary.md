# Chapter 16 - Summary

Professor Oak extracts the kids on Dragonite and confronts Dr. Fuji; Ditto becomes Dragonite, Fuji mutates Magmar with a serum, and collateral damage rips through Pallet before Oak's team turns the tide.

- Story: [Chapter 16](./chapter16.md)

## What happens:
### 1. Extraction and engagement:
*   Dragonite lifts Amber and Ash to safety under Protect as Oak leaps back into the fight.
*   Arcanine smashes Magmar off‑angle, disrupting a lethal Flamethrower.

### 2. 3‑on‑2 street battle:
*   Ditto transforms into Dragonite; Oak fields Exeggutor and Tauros.
*   Gravity pins Ditto‑Dragonite while Tauros and Arcanine pressure Magmar; Hyper Beam and Smog escalate the danger.

### 3. Serum escalation:
*   Fuji injects a pink serum into Magmar; its body grotesquely mutates (cannon‑like arm) and Overheat injures Oak.
*   Tauros guts through status with Facade; Earthquake and coordinated pressure begin to swing momentum.

### 4. Turning point:
*   Ditto flickers and reverts; Oak's team, enraged, forces Fuji back as officers evacuate neighbors.
*   The battlefield stabilizes with Oak's trio in control and Fuji's options narrowing.

## Potential speculation:
*   **Unstable bio‑augmentation:** The serum hints at weaponized research (Team Rocket or related), raising stakes for future conflicts.
*   **Ditto's transformation ceiling:** Matching Dragonite's apparent strength suggests a unique Ditto tied to Mewtwo‑era experiments.
*   **Political consequences:** Widespread damage in Pallet may draw League scrutiny, impacting Oak's lab and security policy.
