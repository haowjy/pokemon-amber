# Chapter 5 - Notes

- Story: ../chapter5.md

## Intent
- Establish gym challenge requirements (licensing system)
- Show Amber's poverty/money issues
- Introduce gym facilities and structure
- Create humorous/tense moments (creepy old man, restricted greenhouse, collision)
- Demonstrate Ditto's social behavior with other Pokémon

## Beats
- Amber approaches Celadon Gym through beautiful ginkgo tree garden
- Creepy old man on bench (avoid at all costs)
- **Ditto in scarf form** (still from Ch4)
- Enters gym lobby, sees price board (₽10,000 spectator, ₽4,000 training pass)
- Approaches receptionist to ask about badge challenge
- **Receptionist dialogue:**
  - "Do you have a trainer ID?" → "No"
  - "Are your parents with you?" → No
  - Explains: Need trainer ID, parents help with junior permit, must pass test
  - **Assumes Amber already has junior permit** (seeing Ditto-scarf, thinks it's legal)
  - Suggests upgrading to trainer ID
  - Can take test at gym or Pokémon Center
- Amber realizes she's broke (₽300 not enough)
- Leaves gym, wanders gardens feeling defeated
- Talks to "Ditto" (still scarf form) about get-rich-quick schemes
- Finds greenhouse (doesn't see "RESTRICTED" sign - too high for child-height)
- **Ditto still in scarf form inside greenhouse**
- Encounters wild Gloom
- **Ditto slides down, transforms to Gloom** (wants to play/socialize)
- Two Glooms dance in rainbow sunlight (peaceful moment)
- Purple-haired gym trainer (15) interrupts, sees Ditto-Gloom
- Ditto's form wavers, reveals pink
- Trainer confused: "What kind of Pokémon is that?"
- Realizes Amber is just a kid, softens
- "Where are your parents?"
- Lets Amber go with warning about "DO NOT ENTER" signs
- Amber sees sign (mounted too high, missed it)
- Gets knocked over by sneezing girl carrying fainted Oddish
- Heads home after "fruitfully long day"

## Continuity
### Ditto Form Progression
- **Entire chapter:** Draped around neck like scarf (pink blob, from Ch4)
  - NOTE: Not transformed into fabric - just positioned scarf-like as pink blob
  - Looks like oddly purple scarf from distance
- **Gym lobby:** Receptionist doesn't notice it's a Pokémon (successful camouflage)
  - She sees "girl with purple scarf" not "girl with Pokémon"
  - Assumes Amber has junior permit based on age/context, not seeing Ditto
- **Greenhouse:** Slides down, transforms to Gloom to socialize
- **After incident:** Presumably drapes around neck again (implied)

### Licensing System Established
- **Junior Permit:** For kids, allows 1 Pokémon, needs parent to register
- **Trainer ID:** Full license, needs test, allows gym challenges
- **Process:** Parent registers junior permit → kid takes test → gets trainer ID → can challenge gym
- **Assumption:** Receptionist thinks Amber has junior permit (normal for kid with Pokémon)
- Test available at gym or Pokémon Center
- Cost not mentioned for registration/test, only facility passes

### Money Problems
- Amber has ₽300 (from Joey battle in Ch4)
- Gym passes cost ₽4,000-10,000
- Can't afford anything
- Sets up need to earn more money

### Gym Structure
- Modern glass/steel building
- Beautiful gardens (ginkgo trees, irises, wisteria, pond)
- Reception desk with price board
- Training facilities (seen on board, not visited)
- League spectator area (for watching official matches)
- Greenhouses (restricted areas for gym Pokémon)
- Staff includes young trainers (15-year-old with Bellsprout)

## Foreshadowing
- Ditto's social nature (wants to play with Gloom)
- Gym trainer notices unusual Pokémon but doesn't pursue
- "Restricted areas" exist (Amber will break more rules?)
- License system will become important plot point
- Amber's child-sized perspective causes problems (can't see signs)

## Character Notes
### Mary (Purple-Haired Gym Trainer)
Based on Cooltrainer Mary from Celadon Gym ([Bulbapedia](https://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/Celadon_Gym)):
- ~15 years old
- Wears Celadon Gym uniform (forest green kimono-style, rainbow badge)
- Has Bellsprout partner (doesn't have Ivysaur yet)
- In canon, she's Erika's "ace trainer" with team: Bellsprout♀ Lv.22, Oddish♀ Lv.22, Weepinbell♀ Lv.22, Gloom♀ Lv.22, Ivysaur♂ Lv.22
- Authoritative but kind to kids
- Curious about unusual Pokémon
- Doesn't report Amber for trespassing

### Kaede (Sneezing Girl)
Based on Kaede from the manga "How I Became a Pokémon Card" (https://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/Kaede):
- 14-15 years old
- Has stolen Oddish from gym (wilted, drooping, unconscious from fall)
- Severely allergic to pollen, flowers, and Grass-type Pokémon (constant sneezing, flushed, red running eyes)
- In a hurry after stealing, apologizes briefly
- Shows caring for Pokémon despite her allergies
- Childhood friends with Erika (revealed in later chapters)
- In original manga, she's a Team Rocket member with an Oddish that evolved into Gloom

## Open Questions
- Will Amber get a junior permit or go straight for trainer ID?
- How will she afford anything?
- Will gym trainer remember the weird transforming Pokémon?
- What's wrong with the sneezing girl's Oddish?

## To-Do
- None
