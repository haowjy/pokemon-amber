# Chapter 4 - Notes

- Story: ../chapter4.md

## Intent
- Amber's first real Pokémon battle
- Show Ditto's transformation abilities publicly
- Introduce consequences: crowd attention and licensing concerns
- Establish battle mechanics (real-time, no turns, status moves work differently)

## Beats
- Amber arrives at Celadon Gym Outer Gardens (public training grounds)
- **Ditto in scarf form** (continuing from Ch3)
- Watches several amateur battles, studies battle mechanics
- Joey challenges her to a battle for ₽300
- **Ditto slides down from scarf, enters battle as pink blob**
- Joey starts battle without warning (no honor among kids)
- Ditto struggles to understand "transform" command initially
- **Ditto transforms into Rattata → CROWD REACTS IMMEDIATELY**
  - Woman stops, stares, whispers to companion
  - Teenage trainers drift closer
  - Murmurs: "What kind of Pokémon?" "Never seen anything like..."
- Amber realizes she's revealing potentially classified experiment (Ditto = failed Mew clone?)
- Battle continues: Tail Whip (status moves work!), Tackle exchanges, Quick Attack
- Ditto wins with superior technique/training
- Joey pays up (good sportsmanship despite being upset)
- **Ditto returns to scarf form autonomously**
- More crowd murmuring about license requirements
- Amber makes Ditto "play dead scarf" and leaves quickly

## Continuity
### Ditto Form Progression
- **Start:** Draped around neck like scarf (pink blob, from Ch3)
  - NOTE: Not transformed into fabric - just positioned scarf-like
  - Weight/warmth familiar after morning walk
- **Battle prep:** Slides down, remains pink blob
- **Battle:** Transforms to Rattata (crowd sees transformation - THIS is the spectacle)
- **Post-battle:** Flows back up, drapes around neck again (pink blob, scarf-like position)
- **Exit:** Goes perfectly still to look like normal scarf
- Leads into Chapter 5 still draped around neck

### Money/Economy
- First earned money: ₽300 from Joey
- Amber feels guilty (hustling a kid) but needs money
- Sets up money problems for Ch5 gym fees

### Battle Mechanics Established
- Real-time combat, no turn-based system
- Status moves work (Tail Whip affects Rattata's confidence)
- Pokémon respond to trainers but have autonomy
- Experience matters (Ditto's training shows)

### Public Attention
- Ditto's transformation ability is RARE/UNUSUAL
- People don't recognize what it is but are fascinated
- License concerns raised by bystanders
- Amber aware she's drawing too much attention

## Foreshadowing
- Ditto's autonomous intelligence (returns to scarf without command)
- License/permit system is real and enforced
- Amber's secret identity risk (daughter of Fuji, Ditto as experiment)
- Battle knowledge translates but isn't perfect (had to learn real-time combat)

## Open Questions
- Will anyone report the unusual Pokémon?
- How common/rare are Dittos in this world?
- When will licensing become a real problem?

## To-Do
- None
