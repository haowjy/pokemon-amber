# Story Structure

Preferred layout for chapter-local notes:

- `story/chapterX/` (folder per chapter)
  - `chapterX.md` (optional future move of the chapter file)
  - `notes.md` (primary author notes for this chapter)
  - `characters.md` (optional, chapter-specific character notes)
  - `pokemon.md` (optional, chapter-specific Pokemon notes)

Current state
- Chapters still live as `story/chapterX.md`.
- Notes stubs added under `story/chapterX/`.

Migration (optional)
1) Move `story/chapterX.md` â†’ `story/chapterX/chapterX.md`.
2) Update wiki links to `../story/chapterX/chapterX.md`.
3) Remove old top-level `chapterX.md`.

We can run this migration in one go when you give the word.
