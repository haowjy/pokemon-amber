# Chapter 6 - Summary

Fuji forges Amber's identity, Team Rocket leadership assesses the fallout from Mewtwo's escape, Domino points Fuji toward Delia, and Fuji's fixation on a "perfect Amber" deepens.

- Story: [Chapter 6](./chapter6.md)

## What happens:
### 1. Dr. Fuji's Domestic Obsession:
*   Dr. Fuji meticulously recreates a past image of Amber, presenting her with an identical blue sundress and observing her unfamiliar mannerisms as "discrepancies to fix."
*   He snaps at Amber when she tugs at the dress, interpreting her flinch as a "flaw to mend," revealing his increasing frustration with the gap between his ideal and the new Amber.
*   He leaves for work, carrying a photograph of his family, still grappling with the loss of his original family and his obsession with recreating it.

### 2. Team Rocket's Covert Operations:
*   Fuji enters a hidden Team Rocket facility via the Celadon Game Corner, where Dr. Gideon provides him with forged documents to establish Amber's false identity as a normal child.
*   Gideon also mentions Agent Domino is looking for Fuji.

### 3. Fallout from Mewtwo's Escape:
*   In a tense conference, Admin Archer confronts Fuji about the catastrophic Mewtwo escape, highlighting the casualties and financial losses.
*   Dr. Samba presents data showing Mewtwo's unprecedented psychic power, while other scientists argue over destroyed projects and the difficulty of recapturing Mewtwo.

### 4. Giovanni's Intervention and Fuji's Ambition:
*   Giovanni, Team Rocket's leader, arrives, interrogating Fuji about Mewtwo's power and human-like ambition, and is warned that Mewtwo "may hold grudges."
*   Giovanni asks if another Mewtwo can be created. Fuji, after internal conflict, admits it's "possible," hinting at his desire for a "perfect Amber."
*   The meeting continues into the night, with ongoing debates over resources and containment.

### 5. Delia's New Life:
*   Fuji meets Agent Domino, who provides him with a folder about his estranged wife, Delia.
*   A photograph reveals Delia with another man, which Fuji accepts as a temporary "obstacle," whispering her name, "Delia," as he contemplates his next move.

## Potential speculation:
*   **Fuji's Psychological State:** Dr. Fuji's escalating obsession with recreating his past, his inability to accept the new Amber as she is, and his controlled anger suggest a deep psychological breakdown and a dangerous path toward forcing his will upon her.
*   **Amber's Vulnerability within Team Rocket:** The forging of Amber's identity and her unwitting connection to Team Rocket through Dr. Fuji place her in a highly vulnerable position, suggesting she is a valuable asset or a potential pawn in the organization's larger plans.
*   **Mewtwo's Revenge:** Fuji's warning that Mewtwo "may hold grudges" foreshadows a potential confrontation between Mewtwo and Team Rocket, particularly Giovanni, and could lead to Mewtwo seeking revenge against its creators.
*   **Giovanni's Calculated Control:** Giovanni's calm demeanor and targeted questions during the chaotic meeting highlight his strategic mind and firm control over Team Rocket, indicating he is a formidable antagonist who sees even setbacks as opportunities.
*   **The "Perfect Amber" Project:** Fuji's internal thought of creating another Mewtwo and a "perfect Amber" reveals his distorted paternal love and scientific ambition, suggesting he views Amber as a scientific project to be optimized rather than a child to be cherished, which could lead to further ethical dilemmas.
*   **Delia's Future Role:** Delia's new relationship and Fuji's whispered mention of her name signify that she will become a target or a crucial element in Fuji's plan to reclaim his family, potentially drawing her into the unfolding conflict and Amber's story.
