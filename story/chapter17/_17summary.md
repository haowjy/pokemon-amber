# Chapter 17 - Summary

Amber wakes to the chaotic aftermath of the previous night's battle. At the hospital, she learns Professor Oak is recovering and Dr. Fuji is in custody. While Delia grieves for her missing husband and the boys act out their own anxieties, Amber has a private conversation with Oak. He entrusts Ditto to her care, safe in its pokeball, and discusses her grim future options, including an orphanage system still recovering from a past war. The conversation leaves Amber shaken, deflecting his questions with panicked absurdity.

- Story: [Chapter 17](./17chapter.md)

## What happens:
### 1. Morning Fallout:
*   Amber wakes at the Ketchum's, anxious about Fuji and Ditto.
*   Delia frantically phones for answers about Oak and her husband, Stephen.
*   Ash and Gary get into a physical fight; Amber is accidentally hit trying to intervene.

### 2. To the Hospital:
*   A call confirms Oak is alive and in the hospital.
*   At the hospital, they meet an exhausted Officer Jenny and Oak's Dragonite. Jenny urges Delia to file a missing person report for Stephen.

### 3. Hospital Waiting Room:
*   The group sees Oak, heavily bandaged but in good spirits.
*   Amber, Ash, and Gary are sent to the hallway while the adults give statements.
*   Ash and Gary fight again, wrangled by a weary Nurse Joy.

### 4. A Private Conversation:
*   Back in the room, Amber speaks privately with Oak while the boys are distracted by a Pokémon battle on TV.
*   Oak explains Fuji is in custody and that his own Pokémon ended the fight.
*   He gives Ditto's pokeball directly to Amber, confirming it is safe and noting its refusal to fight for Fuji at the end.
*   Oak explains Amber's uncertain future, mentioning the grim possibility of an orphanage and referencing "the War."
*   When Oak asks her age, Amber panics and deflects with a nonsensical question about ramen.

## Potential speculation:
*   **Guardianship path:** Delia, Oak, or League custody could define Amber's next chapter and support system.
*   **Ditto's future:** Now in Amber's possession, Ditto's fate is directly tied to hers. Its refusal to fight for Fuji and its unique strength will likely be key plot points.
*   **World context:** The direct reference to "the War" confirms a darker history, suggesting the world's institutions (like orphanages) are harsh and under-resourced, framing Amber's precarious situation.
*   **Amber's secret:** Oak's pointed question about her age and her panicked reaction suggests he may suspect she is not a normal child.
