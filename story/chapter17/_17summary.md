# Chapter 17 - Summary

At the hospital, Oak is alive and Fuji is in custody; Delia is shattered, the boys act out, and Amber faces an uncertain legal status while Ditto's safety is confirmed.

- Story: [Chapter 17](./chapter17.md)

## What happens:
### 1. Morning fallout:
*   Delia frantically phones for answers; school is cancelled; Ash and Gary scuffle.

### 2. Hospital updates:
*   Call confirms Oak is alive; Dragonite returns; Officer Jenny explains the night's response and urges a missingâ€‘person report for Stephen.
*   Oak lies bandaged but stable; formal statements begin.

### 3. Waiting and frayed nerves:
*   Nurse Joy wrangles the boys in the hall while adults give statements.

### 4. Answers and uncertainty:
*   Oak tells Amber that Ditto is unharmed and in custody for questioning, noting its gentle reluctance to fight.
*   He explains Amber may fall under Indigo League orphan care absent known guardians, and obliquely references "the War."

## Potential speculation:
*   **Guardianship path:** Delia, Oak, or League custody could define Amber's next chapter and support system.
*   **Ditto's future:** Its reluctance and bond with Amber suggest eventual release or partnership under supervision.
*   **World context:** References to the War hint at a harsher, institutional backdrop that may shape League policy and Amber's options.
