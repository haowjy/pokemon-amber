# Trapinch Capture Playbook
A consolidated reference of **possible paths** for Amber to acquire **Trapinch** early in Kanto. Structured to mix-and-match. No prose; beats only.

---

## Ground Rules (canon/style constraints)

- Amber is **10**; reactions are simple, brave, not world-wise
- **Off-route** near Route 1 (toward rough backcountry) is valid: **not Ranger-maintained**, stronger wilds
- **Fainted Pokemon cannot be recalled**
- **No Giovanni** onstage. Team Rocket presence = **grunts**; optional recurring **Butch & Cassidy** (B&C). **Domino** = rare, surgical cameo
- **Nonlethal** conflict; short skirmishes
- **Minimal bureaucracy** on page
- Keep the **rescue** the emotional center when used

---

## Placement Options (choose one)

### 1) Early (Ch7-9 timeframe)
- Immediate second partner after Ditto
- **Why:** Kickstart B&C recurring pursuit; intimate, formative moment
- **Cons:** Amber less experienced

### 2) Mid (3-6 months)
- Amber shows learned rescue skill
- **Why:** Believable technique gains; slower emotional burn
- **Original suggestion:** Post-license, before leaving Viridian area

### 3) Late (≈1 year)
- Patience/rehab arc emphasis
- **Why:** Deep payoff; coach-style story
- **Note:** If B&C arc is core, prefer **Early**

**Recommended (from previous planning):** After Arc 1 foundation (Route 1 survival + Viridian license + initial Team Rocket awareness)

**Reasons to delay from immediate:**
- Needs combat confidence to stand up to Rocket grunts
- Off-route wilderness requires survival experience
- Choosing to protect = growth from "I cause suffering" mindset
- Works better with Ditto + first companion for strategic battle

---

## Path Archetypes (pick 1 primary + 0-2 toggles)

### A) Off-Route Rescue (Wild Attack) — DEFAULT

**Premise:** Amber wanders into an unmaintained spur; Trapinch is being harried by wilds.

**Beats (6-8)**
1. Hear scrabble/squeal; locate half-buried Trapinch under pressure (e.g., **Raticate + Spearow** pack)
2. **Ditto** goes broad-shield; Amber clears **grit behind jaw hinge**, drip water to gums
3. Command: **"Hold"** (jaw freeze) → **"Down/Bury"** a half-shroud
4. Wilds probe again → **Sand scatter** / low body-checks; short repel
5. **B&C arrive late** with fake Ranger bands: "non-native specimen; hand it over."
6. Terrain spike (tree slam/roar) + Ditto shield angle → B&C retreat
7. Amber **escorts** or light-taps capture (after stabilization)
8. Off-page: brief Center intake; ownership ping set for later reveal

**Pros/Cons:** +Intimate, clean. −Requires quick handling realism.

**Toggles:** Domino silent observer (clipboard), or none. Swap attackers (Beedrill, Spearow, Mankey).

---

### B) Collapsed Hollow / Cave-In Assist

**Premise:** Rain undermines a burrow; Trapinch trapped in a shallow collapse.

**Beats**
1. Detect **subsoil breathing** (faint clicks) near a sink
2. Mark safe triangle; **Ditto as brace**; slow hand-dig along tooth line
3. Airway clear → water on gums; **head level**, no yank
4. Minor rockfall → reposition brace; exit route chalk
5. **B&C** show with "quarantine" story; Amber refuses mid-extraction
6. Micro-collapse forces all to scramble; B&C bail
7. Surface; cloth wrap/warmth; gentle ball tap optional
8. Center check (off-page)

**Pros/Cons:** +Showcases methodical care. −Less combat pop.

---

### C) Storm-Soaked Field (Hypothermia Save)

**Premise:** Drizzle/cold; Trapinch failing to thermoregulate.

**Beats**
1. Shiver; shallow pit wrong depth; water pooling
2. **Windbreak + dry barrier** (Ditto tarp)
3. Warmth pack at **thorax**, not overheat; incremental
4. Wild opportunists circle; simple deterrent
5. B&C appear; Amber cites Center policy; keeps working
6. A whistle/light = witnesses → B&C vanish
7. Stabilized; escort/capture
8. Later: nurse mentions **non-native** note (one line)

**Pros/Cons:** +Caretaker tone. −Low action unless paired with minor skirmish.

---

### D) Poacher Interference (Non-Rocket)

**Premise:** Independent snare line; Trapinch injured by illegal clamp near off-route.

**Beats**
1. Find **snare**, bruised hinge; cut safely; disinfect
2. Poacher returns → tries bluff; Amber deflects; short scare-off
3. **B&C** arrive hoping to "buy" the specimen; poacher vs Rocket squabble
4. Amber uses confusion to exit with Trapinch
5. Report (off-page) to Ranger desk via Center

**Pros/Cons:** +Grimy realism; +varied villainy. −Extra NPC noise.

---

### E) Center-First Custody (Hand-In → Sting)

**Premise:** Amber carries Trapinch straight to a Center; B&C attempt a **paperwork sting** there.

**Beats**
1. Intake nurse logs **non-native**; "temp custody" tag applied
2. **Forged Recovery Order** arrives (B&C): wrong sub-district or form code
3. Amber **stalls**: "Please call Ranger desk to confirm."
4. Crowd forms; **Ditto** innocently "trips" a grab attempt
5. Optional **Domino** steps in as "compliance auditor," pulls them out
6. Nurse flags the forgeries; "Do-Not-Serve" board updated
7. Transfer/claim held; Amber retains custody or gets clean adopt

**Pros/Cons:** +Urban tension; +low combat; −Administrative scene (keep snappy).

---

### F) Back-Alley Net → Pivot to Ditto

**Premise:** After any path above, B&C pivot: **Ditto** is the hotter asset.

**Beats**
1. Alley lure; janky **"morph-freeze" foam** canisters
2. Amber breaks LOS; **sand scatter**; Ditto blocks vents
3. Foam **clogs their gloves**; one slips; retreat with threats
4. Running gag: they promise to "file a claim for damages."

**Pros/Cons:** +Recurring foil engine. −Use sparingly.

---

### G) Illegal Release Reclaim

**Premise:** Legal drama minimal but real. Former owner (Hoenn teen) **disclaimed** earlier; Rockets try to exploit ambiguity.

**Beats**
1. Center shows **"Owner: Hoenn ID — Disclaimed"** (later scene, not at rescue)
2. B&C arrive waving a fake **reclaim** from "family agent."
3. One tiny tell (seal color, font) → stall/call → they bolt

**Pros/Cons:** +Confirms abandonment without melodrama. −Paperwork flavor only.

---

### H) Auction Room Interruption (Celadon backroom)

**Premise:** Trapinch appears in a gray-market lot; Amber stumbles onto it (escort gig or tip).

**Beats**
1. Identify pen; verify it's the same individual (scar/mark)
2. Trigger small **blackout** (ally or chance)
3. **Ditto decoy** creates second Trapinch; switch
4. Quiet exit; later Center intake

**Pros/Cons:** +Heist vibe. −Less "found family" tone; more caper.

---

### I) Ranger Board [Rescue] Contract (Minimal chatter)

**Premise:** A [Rescue] posting for a **fainted non-native** on off-route spur.

**Beats**
1. One-liner at board; license flash
2. Go, stabilize, extract; short wild skirmish
3. B&C show at **handover**, try forged form; fail
4. Clean completion; Amber opts to keep (or later adopt)

**Pros/Cons:** +Integrates Quest system. −Avoids intimacy if over-explained (keep lean).

---

## Butch & Cassidy Integration (pick intensity)

**Low:** Only **Encounter 1** (late to rescue) + vanish

**Medium (recommended):**
- Encounter 1 → **Center sting** (E) → **Ditto pivot** (F)

**High:**
- Add **Freight blackout** set-piece (clinic transfer with Magnemite jammer) after F
- Handler (Domino) yanks them for heat

**Running tells:**
- Wrong crest
- Wrong form code
- Cheap gear overheating
- Corporate phrasing ("company policy demands restitution")

**Recurring element:** They call Amber "antlion kid" in future encounters

---

## Domino Touchpoints (optional, 1 max early)

**Center Audit:**
- Clipboard, 1-2 questions
- Signs off
- Later you notice the card's embossing = wrong department

**Handler Leash Tug:**
- Steps in mid B&C scene
- Two words → retreat

**Good Samaritan:**
- Hands a thermal blanket off-route
- Vanishes
- Blanket later has a tag

**Tone:** Competent, minimal, surgical. No explicit Fuji/Mewtwo references.

---

## Hoenn Trainee (Original Owner) - Backstory

**Background (revealed LATER, not at rescue):**
- **Dad purchased Trapinch as starter** (prestige buy)
- After seeing Giovanni's **Flygon** on TV, came to **Viridian hoping to learn from Giovanni**
- Giovanni is rarely present and delays challenges, so **nothing was happening**
- In Hoenn, the trainer's **other captures outgrew** this starter; he **lost interest**
- During Kanto training, Trapinch **fainted** off-route; the trainer **left and didn't report** it
- Rich family; money isn't the issue—he just didn't want it anymore

**Reveal options:**
- Center later shows **"Owner: Hoenn ID — Disclaimed"**
- Trainer appears much later; admits he **bailed** (apology, defensiveness, or one-line closure)
- Or never shown on-page

**Flygon / Viridian Gym Context:**
- Giovanni has publicly used **Flygon in televised gym matches**
- Giovanni himself is **not** part of this arc/scene

---

## Aftermath Handling (choose the lightest that fits)

**Quiet adopt:**
- Nurse: "Owner disclaimed; with your license, we can finalize." One line.

**Temp custody:**
- Amber keeps Trapinch under Center observation
- Paperwork concluded off-page

**Escort only:**
- Amber escorts to Hidden Village/Melanie for rehab
- Capture delayed to later chapter

---

## Training On-Ramp (first 2 weeks, non-expository)

**Commands:**
- **Hold** (jaw freeze)
- **Release** (jaw relax)
- **Down/Bury** (half-shroud, defensive position)
- **Circle** (controlled sand ring)

**Drills:**
- Jaw control on dowels
- Ring-dig around cones
- Short work/rest cycles

**Care:**
- Dry rest pans
- Warmth after rain
- Grit checks behind hinge

**Ditto synergy:**
- Tarp/ground sheet in rain
- Decoy target for safe snaps

---

## Continuity Hooks (seed lightly)

- Same Rocket duo reappears and calls Amber "antlion kid"
- Nurse mentions **non-native** paperwork once; later a **Hoenn ID — disclaimed** line appears
- A Nightveil (ninja-bat) scout notes Amber's sand discipline (if you want stealth overlap)

---

## Pitfalls to Avoid

- **Charmander vigil copy:** Don't make it a "waiting for master" scene; it's **rescue/care**, not vigil
- **Admin bloat:** Keep Center scenes under 6 lines
- **Over-Rocketing:** One early showdown + one Center sting is enough for Act I
- **Too on-the-nose:** Don't exposition dump Hoenn trainer backstory at rescue

---

## Quick Pick Menus

### If you want **maximum heart** and **recurring B&C**:
- Paths: **A → E → F** (+ optional blackout set-piece later)
- Domino: **Center Audit** once
- Aftermath: **Quiet adopt**

### If you want **quiet realism** (low Rocket), more nature:
- Paths: **B or C**, no B&C on site → later **E** with a forgery fail
- Domino: none
- Aftermath: **Temp custody** then adopt

### If you want a **caper vibe**:
- Paths: **H** (auction) → **F** (Ditto pivot)
- Domino: **Leash Tug** or none
- Aftermath: **Escort only** first; capture later

---

## Micro-Beats Library (plug anywhere)

- "Shade first, water on gums, head level."
- "Hold" = jaw freeze; "Release" = jaw relax.
- Ditto forms **ground sheet**; pulls both 2 meters out of smoke.
- "Wrong stamp color" on a fake Ranger form → stall → call desk.
- Foam **backspray** gums the attacker's own gloves.
- Amber clears **grit behind jaw hinge** (specific care detail).
- **Sand scatter** as defensive move.
- Terrain spike (tree slam/roar) forces retreat.

---

## Thematic Function

### For Amber
- First time actively choosing to protect another being
- Growth from "I cause suffering" to "I can help"
- Standing up to Team Rocket = reclaiming agency
- Taking responsibility for another Pokemon

### For Story
- Introduces Team Rocket as active threat (not just surveillance)
- Demonstrates off-route danger (worldbuilding)
- Shows Amber's combat capability growth
- Trapinch = powerful late-game Pokemon (Flygon evolution)

### Worldbuilding
- Off-route wilderness is genuinely dangerous
- Fainted Pokemon are vulnerable
- Team Rocket operates in gray areas
- Rich trainers abandon Pokemon casually

---

## Team Considerations

### If Trapinch is second Pokemon (instead of Cubone/Eevee):
- Ground-type (good coverage)
- Defensive fighter (low mobility, high power)
- Late bloomer (Vibrava at 35, Flygon at 45 - long arc)
- Visual: small, determined, underestimated

### If Trapinch is third Pokemon (after Route 1 companion):
- Complements existing team
- Demonstrates Amber can handle more responsibility
- Adds power potential for late-game

---

## Open Decisions (leave flexible)

- Exact wild attackers in A/C
- If B&C get **reassigned** after early failures or go quiet then pop up once
- Timing of the **Hoenn trainer** reveal (Center later, or a meet months later)
- Whether the **earlier Ursaring-lure** by grunts is canonical or removed
- Whether the **Center/Ranger scan & ownership disclaimer** is shown on-page or fully off-page
