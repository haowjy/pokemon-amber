# Completed Revisions Archive

**Historical record of completed story revisions**

This file archives completed work for reference. Active planning should focus on future chapters.

---

## Chapter 16 Ending (DONE - 2025-10-12)

### Revisions Made

- Oak survives Overheat, stays conscious throughout
- Commands surprise finishing combo after Fuji thinks he won
- Fuji desperately commands Ditto - Ditto refuses to fight
- Fuji breaks down: "I just wanted my daughter back"
- Oak secures Ditto using pokeballs fallen from Fuji's coat
- Oak discovers Magmar is DEAD (forced evolution bypassed fainting)
- Ends on Oak's cold expression looking at Fuji

### Purpose

- Establishes Ditto's loyalty to Amber (refuses Fuji)
- Shows consequences of forced evolution (death, not fainting)
- Oak remains capable and conscious (not helpless)
- Sets up Ditto return in Chapter 17
- Fuji's emotional breakdown humanizes him before consequences

### File Location

`story/chapter16/16chapter.md` (lines 355-366 and surrounding context)

## Chapter 17 Ditto Return (DONE - 2025-10-12)

### Revisions Made

- Oak retrieves pokeball from bedside table (with his personal effects)
- Hands Ditto directly to Amber during hospital conversation
- Amber's emotional reaction - relief and gratitude
- Oak's observations about Ditto's strength and refusal to fight
- Foreshadowing: Oak's "unreadable expression" with "recognition? Certainty?"
- Sets up either time loop or instinct motivation for future

### Purpose

- Ditto returned early (Chapter 17 instead of delayed)
- Emotional payoff (Amber reunited with only companion)
- Establishes Oak observes and understands significance
- Plants ambiguity for Oak's role (time loop or instinct)
- Shows Oak's trust by returning Ditto without conditions

### File Location

`story/chapter17/17chapter.md` (lines 241-259)

### Key Line (Foreshadowing)

> Oak watched me for a moment, an unreadable expression crossing his features. There was something in his eyesâ€”recognition? Certainty? I couldn't quite place it. Then he simply nodded.

**Note:** This line intentionally leaves both Oak role options (time loop vs. instinct) viable for future story.

## Forged Documents Revelation (Confirmed - 2025-10-12)

### Decision Made

- Oak found forged documents on Fuji after arrest
- Documents list Delia Ketchum as Amber's mother/legal guardian
- Created without Delia's knowledge or consent
- Appear legitimate (Fuji was thorough)

### Purpose

- Creates impossible situation for Delia (legally trapped)
- Motivates Delia's breakdown at Stephen's funeral
- Forces Amber to run away (can't contest without revealing truth)
- Both Delia and Amber are Fuji's victims
- Drives early story beats (Pallet departure, Route 1 survival)

## Path A Confirmation (CONFIRMED - 2025-10-12)

### Decision Made

Story will follow Path A: Age 10 departure, real-time journey (NOT 5-year timeskip to age 15)

### Rationale

- On-screen discovery (readers learn WITH Amber)
- Adult mind + child body tension maintained
- Survival stakes create compelling narrative
- Character growth shown, not told
- Found family formation happens organically
- Economic/practical realities of trainer life explored

### Impact

- Chapters 18+ will follow immediate aftermath
- ~1 month at Pallet, then departure
- Route 1 survival arc
- Viridian license exam at age 10
- Real-time companion bonding

### Related Planning

See: `core/path-confirmed.md` for full details
