# Core Thematic Direction

## The Clone/Creation/Identity Triangle

**This is the story's heart.**

### Amber

- Clone with trace Mew DNA (from wiki/_plot-secrets.md)
- Not Fuji's daughter (rejected that identity)
- Not her old self (isekai'd consciousness in clone body)
- Grappling with "what am I?" throughout journey

### Ditto

- Failed Mew clone (established in wiki)
- Exceptional abilities but still "defective" in Fuji's eyes
- Bonded with Amber (two "failures" finding each other)
- Parallel identity journey: what IS a Ditto?

### Mewtwo

- The "successful" clone (Fuji's true obsession)
- Rage against creators, purpose, existence
- Dark mirror to Amber (what she could become)
- Eventual confrontation opportunity

## Thematic Core

**"Two artificial beings trying to prove they're more than failed experiments"**

### Why This Is Stronger Than Canon Crossovers

- Built into existing lore
- Personal, emotional stakes
- Original story not tied to Ash's timeline
- Explores identity, creation, purpose, worth

## Themes to Keep Central

- **Identity/creation vs. choice:** What makes something "real" or "alive"?
- **Found family:** Bonds formed by choice, not obligation
- **Independence vs. community:** Strength in accepting help
- **Masks and hiding:** Everyone hides something (Ditto transforms, Cubone's skull, Amber's mind)
- **Failure and worth:** Being "defective" doesn't define value
- **The question:** "What am I?" â†’ "I choose who I am"
