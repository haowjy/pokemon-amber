# Path B: Confirmed Story Direction

This document outlines the new, confirmed story path, which includes a five-year timeskip. This supersedes the previous "Path A" plan.

## Core Concepts

- **5-Year Timeskip:** The story includes a 5-year timeskip after an initial prologue.
- **Journey at 15:** The official Pokémon journey starts at age 15, functioning as a cultural equivalent to college.
- **Strained Family Dynamic:** Amber lives with Delia and Ash during the timeskip, but their relationship is difficult and strained.

## Story Structure

### Prologue (Age 10)

1.  **Departure:** Following Stephen's funeral and the revelation of the forged documents making Delia her legal guardian, Amber runs away from Pallet Town.
2.  **Route 1:** She struggles to survive on Route 1 and is saved by Flint (Brock's father), who, as a result of this encounter, returns to his family in Pewter City, altering that timeline.
3.  **Viridian City:** Amber reaches Viridian and attempts to get a trainer license but is denied due to her age, being told the official age is 15.
4.  **Giovanni Encounter:** She has a chance encounter with Giovanni at the Viridian Gym. He recognizes her as Dr. Fuji's daughter, which gives him key insights into Fuji's motivations. The encounter leaves Amber deeply frightened.
5.  **Return:** With no other options, Amber returns to Pallet Town to live with Delia and Ash.

### The Timeskip (Ages 10-15)

- **Strained Life:** Amber lives with Delia and Ash. The relationship is tense and fraught with unspoken grief and the trauma of Stephen's death and Amber's origins.
- **Education:** She attends school, learning about the Pokémon world, training, and battle theory from a more academic perspective.
- **Social Life:** She befriends another girl in Pallet Town who will become her future traveling companion.

### Main Journey (Age 15+)

1.  **Official Start:** Amber turns 15 and receives her official trainer license.
2.  **Companion:** She begins her journey with her friend from Pallet Town, a non-ambitious girl with a Sentret, who is using the journey for self-discovery.
3.  **Main Arcs:** The story will now follow modified versions of the "Discovery" and "Acceptance" arcs. The focus will be on Amber's identity as a clone, her connection to Ditto and Mewtwo, and the escalating threat from Team Rocket, which was seeded by her earlier encounter with Giovanni.

## Key Worldbuilding Changes

- **Trainer Age:** The official journey starts at 15.
- **Starter Pokémon:** Most new trainers acquire a starter at 15, often through a government loan program. Trainers with a prior Pokémon bond, like Amber, are the exception.
- **Brock's Timeline:** A new timeline is created for Brock and his family due to Flint's return.

## Implications for Existing Plans

- `arcs/arc1-survival.md` is now obsolete.
- Other documents in the `zz_future` directory will be reviewed and updated to align with this new path.
