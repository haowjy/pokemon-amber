# World-Building to Explore On-Screen

**Things Amber (and readers) discover in real-time through experience**

Path A's greatest strength is **on-screen discovery** - readers learn WITH Amber, not through exposition.

---

## Pokemon Realities

### Wild Pokemon Behavior
- Wild Pokemon are **territorial, not friendly**
- Attack intruders, defend resources
- Battles for berries, water sources, territory
- **Death is rare but real** (not just fainting)
- Species have general traits, but individuals have personalities

### Battle Mechanics
- **Fainted Pokemon cannot be recalled** (vulnerability)
- Battle sustenance system (gradual understanding)
- Type advantages matter but aren't absolute
- Trainer skill vs. Pokemon power balance
- Moves learned through training, not just leveling

### Pokemon-Human Bonds
- Energy link between trainer and active Pokemon
- Backlash when Pokemon faint (cumulative)
- Six-Pokemon limit is physiological, not arbitrary
- Trust builds over time, not instant
- Pokemon choose to follow commands (not mind control)

---

## Trainer Culture

### Economic Realities
- **Pokeballs expensive** (₽200 each - significant cost)
- **Quests pay low** (₽50-200 for basic work)
- Most trainers struggle financially
- Rich kids have massive advantages (bred Pokemon, supplies, tutors)
- Many quit due to money running out

### Journey as "College"
- **Cultural expectation** to attempt journey (ages 13-15 typical)
- Not trying = social stigma, limited job prospects
- **Most fail/quit after 2-3 badges** (respectable outcome)
- Journey proves work ethic, not necessarily success
- Parents save for years to fund their kids' journeys

### Social Hierarchies
- **Unlicensed** (1 Pokemon) = lowest status, limited options
- **Licensed** (2-6 Pokemon) = respectable, employable
- **Badge holders** = successful, doors open with each badge
- **Conference qualified** = top 1%, elite status
- Ace Trainers (Elite Badge) = regional celebrities

### Sponsorship Systems
- **Professor starters** = prestigious, rare (Oak's students)
- **Gym scholarships** = talented trainers get support/training
- **Ranger programs** = government-funded public service track
- **Family Pokemon** = breeding operations for children's starters
- **Corporate sponsors** = rare, high-achievers only (Silph Co., Devon Corp)

### Common Outcomes
- **2-3 badges:** Respectable, demonstrates work ethic, employable
- **4-6 badges:** Very successful, management/specialist positions
- **7-8 badges:** Elite achievement, leadership track, celebrity
- **Conference qualification:** Top 1%, can pursue Champion path if desired
- Most return to: gym employment, breeding, Pokemon Centers, Rangers

## Post-War World

### Orphan Crisis
- **Orphans common** throughout region
- Registry chaos (forged documents easier, like Amber's)
- Many war orphans on journeys early (necessity, not choice)
- Social services overwhelmed
- Some towns have orphan programs (Lavender Tower?)

### Reconstruction
- **Some towns still rebuilding** from war damage
- Infrastructure gaps (routes less maintained in areas)
- Economic disparities widened by war
- Military/Ranger presence higher than pre-war
- Veterans working as trainers, guards, Rangers

### Security State
- **Team Rocket dismissed as conspiracy theories** (at first)
- People want normalcy, ignore warning signs
- Government surveillance increased but inefficient
- Registration systems tighter (but still exploitable)
- Paranoia about "next war" vs. complacency

### Military/Ranger Presence
- Rangers patrol routes more actively
- Military has stronger Pokemon divisions
- Some strong trainers recruited for defense
- Weapons technology advancing (equalizing vs. Pokemon)
- Tension between traditional (Pokemon) and modern (military) power

---

## Gym System

### Gym Leader Roles
- **Local governors** managing cities/towns
- First line of defense for their regions
- Set badge standards (Elite vs. Basic)
- Economic leaders (gyms employ trainers)
- Report to Elite Four/Champion (regional government)

### Badge System
- **Basic Badge** = competency demonstrated
- **Elite Badge** = exceptional skill, Ace Trainer status
- Each gym sets own standards
- Badges = trust, not just battle wins
- Progression isn't linear (can challenge any gym, but harder gyms last)

### Gym Economies
- Employ trainers for various roles
- Offer scholarships to promising students
- Revenue from challenges, tournaments, training programs
- Some wealthy (Celadon), some struggling (Pewter post-war)

---

## Technology & Infrastructure

### Pokeball Technology
- Expensive precision engineering (Silph Co. monopoly)
- Different grades (basic, great, ultra = different costs/quality)
- Recall only works on conscious Pokemon
- Energy signature links Pokemon to ball
- Black market balls exist (lower quality, risky)

### Pokemon Centers
- Free healing (regional government subsidy)
- Storage systems for licensed trainers
- Registration services
- Emergency treatment available
- Some centers better funded than others

### Communication
- Pokegear = expensive (₽1000+)
- Not everyone has one (Amber doesn't at first)
- Phone booths in towns
- Letters/mail still common
- News travels through broadcasts and word-of-mouth

---

## Discovery Method (Show, Don't Tell)

### Through Experience
- Amber learns by doing (trial and error)
- Mistakes have consequences
- Other trainers share knowledge informally
- Observations contradict meta knowledge
- Gradual understanding, not info dumps

### Through Conversations
- Casual dialogue reveals culture
- Other trainers mention "common knowledge"
- Overheard conversations provide context
- Questions to Pokemon Center staff, Rangers, etc.
- Mary or other companions explain things naturally

### Through Consequences
- Running out of money teaches economics
- Pokemon fainting teaches battle rules
- Getting lost teaches geography
- Social rejection teaches hierarchies
- Exhaustion teaches limits

---

## Integration Notes

**Don't:**
- Info dump worldbuilding in exposition
- Have Amber explain things she "just knows"
- Use NPCs as walking encyclopedias
- Front-load explanations before experience

**Do:**
- Show Amber learning through mistakes
- Use natural dialogue to reveal culture
- Demonstrate consequences of world rules
- Layer understanding gradually over chapters
- Trust readers to infer from context
