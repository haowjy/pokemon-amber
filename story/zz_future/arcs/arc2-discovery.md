# Arc 2: Discovery/Identity

**Focus:** Learning about origins, confronting past

## Core Narrative Question

What does it mean to be "artificial"? Can something created rather than born have genuine identity?

## Time Frame

~6-12 months after Arc 1 (flexible)

## Major Beats

### Setup (Past Catches Up)
- Team Rocket surveillance becomes obvious
- Can't keep running from questions about origins
- Fuji's "death" (jail scene) - public believes suicide
- Amber starts investigating own history

### Rising Action (Active Pursuit)
- Team Rocket escalates from observation to pursuit
- Direct attempts to acquire Ditto
- Companions dragged into danger because of her
- Discovery she's been tracked since Pallet

### Complications (Identity Questions)
- Learning more about Fuji's research
- Understanding Ditto's failed Mew clone status
- Parallel: both are "defective" creations
- What does being a clone mean?
- Meets other "created" Pokemon?

### Midpoint (Truth Shared?)
- Companions discover/sense something is off
- Sabrina's psychic sense intensifies
- Decision: reveal truth or keep hiding?
- Test of found family: acceptance vs. rejection

### Crisis (Confrontation)
- Major Team Rocket confrontation
- Forces use of everything learned in Arc 1
- Companions prove loyalty
- Oak intervention? (depending on role decision)

### Climax (Understanding)
- Breakthrough about identity
- "Artificial" doesn't mean "fake"
- Choices matter more than creation method
- Ditto parallel: we're both failed experiments who became real

### Resolution (Acceptance Begin)
- Still questions, but framework for answers
- Companions stand by her (found family solidified)
- Team Rocket threat contained (for now)
- Sets up Arc 3: choosing own meaning

## Character Arc

**Start:** Hiding origins, afraid of being discovered as "not real"
**Journey:** Learning what artificial means, confronting creator's legacy
**End:** Understanding creation method ≠ identity, choices define self

## Challenge Type

**Existential threat and identity crisis**
- Team Rocket actively pursues Fuji's research/Ditto
- Physical danger escalates
- Emotional: what am I really?
- Social: will people reject me if they know?
- Philosophical: can clones have genuine identity?

## Growth Demonstrated

- Facing past instead of running
- Trusting others with truth
- Understanding Ditto's parallel journey
- Defining self through choices, not origin
- Relying on found family

## Theme Exploration

**Identity: Creation vs. Choice**
- "What am I?" → "I choose who I am"
- Artificial doesn't mean fake
- Bonds formed by choice are real
- Failed experiments can become whole people
- Ditto is real despite being "failed Mew"

## Potential Episodes

- Team Rocket active confrontations
- Discovering Fuji's notes/research
- Meeting other created Pokemon
- Sabrina sensing/discovering truth
- Companion loyalty test
- Learning about Mewtwo's existence
- Fuji "death" revelation and investigation
- Oak reveals time loop? (if chosen)

## Parallel Threads

### Ditto's Journey
- Understanding its own identity
- Failed Mew clone but unique being
- Chooses Amber over everyone else
- Mirror to Amber's arc

### Fuji's Shadow
- "Dead" but legacy lingers
- Team Rocket wants his research
- Ethical questions about creation
- Mewtwo somewhere out there

### Found Family Tested
- Companions learn truth
- Choose to stay
- "I don't care what you are, you're my friend"
- Prove found family > blood family

## Ending State

**Amber has:**
- Confronted origins and identity questions
- Shared truth with companions (or they discovered it)
- Survived Team Rocket active pursuit
- Framework for understanding artificial identity
- Solidified found family bonds

**Setup for Arc 3:**
- Mewtwo confrontation looming
- Need to choose own purpose/meaning
- Team Rocket may return
- Oak's full role revealed (time loop or not)
