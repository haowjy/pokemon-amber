# Arc 1: Survival/Independence

**Focus:** Proving she can make it alone

## Core Narrative Question

Can Amber survive on her own in the Pokemon world as a 10-year-old with adult trauma?

## Time Frame

~2-6 months after leaving Pallet (flexible)

## Major Beats

### Setup (Pallet Departure)
- ~1 month tension with Delia
- Stephen's funeral - public rejection
- Amber flees with just Ditto
- Legally allowed (1 Pokemon = right)

### Rising Action (Route 1 Survival)
- 1-2 weeks alone in wilderness
- Learning harsh realities of wild Pokemon
- Competition for berries, water, shelter
- Ditto as only companion/support
- Physical danger, hunger, exhaustion

### Midpoint (Viridian License)
- Passes Trainer License exam at age 10
- Barely succeeds (adult knowledge + Ditto's strength)
- Unlocks ability to catch more Pokemon
- Small victory but still fundamentally alone

### Development (First Companion Pokemon)
- Encounters Route 1 Pokemon (Cubone/Eevee/other)
- Mutual survival bonding
- First time choosing to protect something
- Growth: "I can help" vs. "I cause suffering"

### Complications (Reality Check)
- Economic barriers (pokeballs expensive, quests low-paying)
- Most trainers are older/more experienced
- Social isolation (other trainers have support)
- Team Rocket surveillance begins (she doesn't notice yet)

### Climax (Test of Independence)
- Major challenge requiring all skills learned
- Options: strong wild Pokemon, Rocket encounter, natural disaster
- Forces her to rely on Pokemon companions
- Realizes pure independence isn't sustainable

### Resolution (Reluctant Connection)
- Companion joins (Mary/Sabrina/other)
- Initially resists deeper connection
- But exhaustion/practicality wins out
- Sets up Arc 2: not alone anymore

## Character Arc

**Start:** Hyper-independent, "I can't burden anyone," trauma response
**Journey:** Learning survival ≠ thriving, exhaustion, isolation costs
**End:** Reluctantly accepting help isn't weakness

## Challenge Type

**Physical survival and economic reality**
- Finding food, water, shelter
- Navigating wild Pokemon danger
- Affording basic supplies
- Managing exhaustion and injury
- Learning to battle effectively

## Growth Demonstrated

- Practical survival skills
- Pokemon battle basics
- Reading wild Pokemon behavior
- Resource management
- Self-reliance limits

## Theme Exploration

**Independence vs. Community**
- Amber proves she CAN survive alone
- But learns survival ≠ living
- Found family begins reluctantly
- Accepting help takes strength, not weakness

## Potential Episodes

- Route 1 survival sequence
- Viridian license exam
- First companion Pokemon bonding
- Economic struggle (quest board, supplies)
- Close call requiring rescue/help
- Early Team Rocket encounter (minor)
- First gym challenge? (optional)

## Ending State

**Amber has:**
- Proven basic survival capability
- Earned Trainer License
- Acquired 2-3 Pokemon
- Reluctantly accepted first companion
- Learned world is harsher than expected

**Setup for Arc 2:**
- Team Rocket surveillance escalates
- Companions become leverage
- Past (Fuji, origins) starts catching up
- Can't run forever
