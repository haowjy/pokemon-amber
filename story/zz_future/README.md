# Future Story Planning - Brainstorming Area

**Status:** All content in this folder is **POTENTIAL**, not set in stone.

This is a brainstorming and exploration space for post-Chapter 17 story direction. Nothing here is locked in unless explicitly marked as **confirmed** in the file's YAML front matter (`status: confirmed`).

---

## Purpose of This Folder

**What this folder is:**
- Exploration of story possibilities
- Brainstorming character options
- Planning potential plot threads
- Tracking decisions that need to be made
- Mix-and-match story beats and scenarios

**What this folder is NOT:**
- Rigid chapter outlines
- Locked-in plot points
- Mandatory story beats
- Final decisions (unless marked confirmed)

---

## Folder Structure

### `core/`
**Confirmed story foundations** - these are locked in decisions that form the base of future planning:
- Path A confirmation (age 10 departure, real-time journey)
- Core themes (clone/creation/identity triangle)
- Meta notes about story focus

**Status:** Generally confirmed, but can be revised if story needs change

---

### `plot/`
**Major plot threads** that span multiple chapters/arcs:
- Forged documents situation
- Team Rocket surveillance
- Oak's role options (time loop vs instinct)
- Giovanni-Fuji jail scene

**Status:** Mix of confirmed and undecided. Individual files specify status.

---

### `characters/`
**Human characters Amber may encounter** - relationship status TBD:
- Could be: companions, rivals, allies, antagonists, passing encounters
- Explores options like Mary (Pewter trainer) or Sabrina (young psychic)
- Relationship dynamics are FLEXIBLE

**Status:** Ideas to explore. No commitment to including any specific character.

---

### `team/`
**Pokemon team members** - if acquired, they're permanent:
- Route 1 companion options (Cubone/Eevee/Meowth/etc)
- Trapinch acquisition playbook
- Future: other potential team members

**Status:** Exploring options. If a Pokemon joins, it's a lasting commitment.

**Note:** Acquisition methods are mix-and-match; multiple paths available per Pokemon.

---

### `arcs/`
**Long-term story arc structures**:
- Arc 1: Survival/Independence
- Arc 2: Discovery/Identity
- Arc 3: Acceptance/Purpose
- Pokemon 4Ever option (if time loop chosen)

**Status:** Rough frameworks, not rigid chapter plans. Flexible and organic.

---

### `episodes/`
**Specific story events or one-off encounters**:
- Currently empty (Trapinch moved to `team/`)
- Reserved for truly episodic content (side quests, one-chapter events)

**Status:** Future use. Not character acquisition - those go in `characters/` or `team/`.

---

### `worldbuilding/`
**On-screen discovery content**:
- Pokemon realities Amber learns through experience
- Trainer culture and economics
- Post-war world context

**Status:** Guides for writing. Shows how to reveal world organically.

---

### `_open-questions.md`
**Decision tracker** for unresolved choices:
- 9+ questions that need answers eventually
- Prioritized by urgency
- Tracks when decisions are made

**Status:** Active tracking document. Update as decisions are made.

---

### `_archive-completed.md`
**Historical record** of completed revisions:
- Chapter 16/17 changes
- Confirmed decisions from previous planning
- Reference only - not active planning

**Status:** Archive. Don't modify unless documenting new completed work.

## How to Use This Folder

### For Planning
1. Start with `core/` to understand confirmed foundations
2. Check `_open-questions.md` for what needs deciding
3. Explore relevant folders for the area you're planning
4. Mix and match options as needed
5. Don't feel constrained by what's written

### For Writing
1. Reference confirmed elements in `core/`
2. Choose from options in exploration files
3. Feel free to deviate if story calls for it
4. Update files if major decisions are made during writing
5. Move completed/confirmed items to `_archive-completed.md`

### For Brainstorming
1. Add new files to appropriate folders
2. Use YAML `status: idea-to-explore` for new concepts
3. Cross-reference related files
4. Don't delete ideas - mark them as `status: rejected` with rationale
5. Keep creative flexibility as priority

---

## File Status Tags (YAML Front Matter)

**`status: confirmed`** - Locked in decision, forms story foundation

**`status: planned`** - Likely to use, but can still change

**`status: idea-to-explore`** - Brainstorming, not committed

**`status: undecided`** - Multiple options, decision pending

**`status: rejected`** - Considered but decided against (keep for reference)

**`status: completed`** - Already written/implemented (archive)

---

## Creative Philosophy

> **"Keep creative flexibility - these are directions, not rigid plans"**

- Story can evolve organically during writing
- Better ideas that emerge take priority
- Reader engagement > rigid plotting
- Character authenticity > predetermined outcomes
- Trust the writing process

---

## What To Do When Story Diverges

**If writing takes a different direction:**
1. That's OKAY and often BETTER
2. Update relevant planning files with what actually happened
3. Adjust future plans based on new direction
4. Move old options to rejected or archive
5. Don't feel bad about deviating from plans

**Remember:** These plans serve the story, not the other way around.

## Questions?

If something in this folder is unclear:
- Check `_open-questions.md` to see if it's a known undecided point
- Look at related files (cross-references at bottom of each file)
- Check `core/themes.md` and `core/meta-notes.md` for story philosophy
- Trust your instincts - if something doesn't feel right, explore alternatives

**Remember:** All of this is POTENTIAL. Explore freely, decide later, write authentically.
