# The Forged Documents Setup

**Central conflict driver for Amber's departure from Pallet**

## What Fuji Did

- Created official-looking medical records, birth certificate for "Amber Fuji"
- Listed **Delia Ketchum** as mother/legal guardian without her knowledge/consent
- Documents appear legitimate (Fuji was thorough)
- Found on his person after arrest

## Why This Matters

- Delia is legally responsible for Amber unless contested
- To contest = investigation, scrutiny, questions about who Amber really is
- Delia feels trapped: legally obligated to care for killer's daughter
- Not just grief over Stephen, but rage at being manipulated post-mortem
- **"I never wanted you! He forced this on me!"**
- Both Delia and Amber are Fuji's victims
- Creates impossible situation forcing Amber to run

## The Immediate Crisis

### At Stephen's Funeral

- Delia's breakdown
- Public rejection of Amber
- Community witnesses the confrontation
- Amber realizes she can't stay where she causes suffering

### Amber's Decision

- Can't contest documents (would reveal her origins)
- Can't stay with Delia (causing more pain)
- Flees with just Ditto (legal, 1 Pokemon = right)
- Becomes functionally homeless at age 10

## Resolution Path (Eventual)

- Oak works to prove forgery
- Takes guardianship himself
- Delia released from legal obligation
- But emotional damage already done

## Complications

- Post-war registry chaos makes forgery easier
- Legal system not equipped to handle clone identity
- Any investigation risks exposing Amber's true nature
- Oak must be careful not to reveal too much while helping
