# Team Rocket Surveillance Plot

**Potential long-term threat escalating from observation to pursuit**

## The Setup

### Why Team Rocket Is Interested

- Team Rocket knows about Fuji's arrest and research
- Amber has documented connection to Dr. Fuji (forged documents list her as daughter)
- They might be watching her to:
  - Recover Fuji's research/notes
  - Acquire Ditto (perfect-copying clone is valuable)
  - Find out what else Fuji created
  - Leverage her to get Fuji to cooperate from jail

### Initial Phase: Passive Observation

- Being followed/watched without realizing
- "Random" encounters that aren't random
- Surveillance begins shortly after leaving Pallet
- Amber doesn't notice yet (inexperienced)

## Escalation Stages

### Stage 1: Background Tracking
- Watchers in crowds
- Reports back to Rocket leadership
- No direct contact
- Establishing patterns, routes, capabilities

### Stage 2: Testing
- "Accidental" encounters
- Low-level grunts probe her reactions
- Assess Ditto's abilities
- Evaluate if she knows anything useful

### Stage 3: Active Pursuit
- Direct attempts to acquire Ditto
- Confrontations become unavoidable
- Companions dragged into danger
- Discovery that she's been tracked since leaving Pallet

## Narrative Tension Points

### Paranoia Element
- Is that trainer watching her or just passing by?
- Which encounters are genuine vs. staged?
- Can she trust anyone she meets?
- Reinforces "everyone I'm close to gets hurt" fear

### Character Impact
- Tests Amber's growing independence
- Forces reliance on companions (theme payoff)
- Raises stakes beyond personal survival
- Eventually requires confrontation/resolution

## Integration With Other Threads

### Connections to:
- **Giovanni-Fuji plot:** Rocket's interest stems from Fuji's value
- **Trapinch episode:** Grunts attempting opportunistic capture
- **Arc 2 (Discovery):** TR pursuit becomes active antagonist
- **Companions:** Their safety becomes leverage against Amber

### Oak's Role
- Does Oak know she's being tracked?
- Is he counter-surveilling?
- At what point does he intervene?
- Balancing protection vs. respecting agency

## Open Questions

1. **When does Amber realize she's being tracked?**
   - Early awareness = constant tension
   - Late reveal = betrayal/paranoia spike

2. **How does she discover it?**
   - Companion notices (Sabrina psychic sense?)
   - Obvious confrontation forces reveal
   - Oak warns her
   - She figures it out herself

3. **What's Rocket's endgame?**
   - Just Ditto?
   - Information about Fuji's other work?
   - Leverage to force Fuji's cooperation?
   - All of the above?

4. **How does it resolve?**
   - Direct confrontation
   - Oak intervention
   - Amber proves not worth the effort
   - Rocket's priorities shift elsewhere
