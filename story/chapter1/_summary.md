## Story beats (big scenes)

Note: Names reflect POV knowledge at the time; label “caretaker” until recognition.

### Story beat 1: Old World
- The protagonist’s Nuzlocke run interrupted by a Discord message announcing a surprise Shadow Mewtwo raid at the campus library
- MC sprints across University Avenue and is struck by a truck-an abrupt, unsentimental end
- Introductions: POV adult (unnamed); online handles only (off-page voices)

### Story beat 2: Awakening
- MC's consciousness returns suspended in amber fluid (some kind of experiment)
- out
- A middle-aged man catches MC, wraps a lab coat around her, and shields her; he is unnamed on-page here and reads through action, tenderness, and urgency.
- Introductions: Caretaker (unnamed); facility context inferred from environment, alarms, and equipment.

### Story beat 3: Lab Chaos
- Mewtwo’s presence distorts the lab; brief eye contact precedes an Arcanine blast. Mewtwo detonates upward through the ceiling into moonlight as debris rains.
- The caretaker carries her through collapsing corridors into a curated mansion interior; scientists scramble, assets are pulled, a glitching Kadabra variant flickers.
- Amid alarms and smoke, the caretaker vows, “We can fix it all-our family, our life.” Mid-flight, the POV connects the dots and names him Dr. Fuji, foregrounding the moral stakes of his choices.
- Introductions: Mewtwo fully present; Dr. Fuji named upon POV recognition; organization scope inferred; “reality-glitch” noted.
