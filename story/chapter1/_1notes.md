# Chapter 1 - Notes

- Story: [./1chapter.md](./1chapter.md)

## Authorial Intent
- Isekai premise: modern player transported at death (truck impact) into the body of Amber Fuji.
- Accessibility: keep MC's gender expression flexible so readers can self-insert; the body is Amber, the voice invites projection.
- Immediate lore tie-in: Mewtwo awakens in the same window; a flash of recognition stays his full destruction.
- Tone: grounded sensory detail, modern voice, awe + dread; show-don't-tell on "underground lab" and identities.

## Sequences (Big Scenes)
- Old World (Campus + Raid Call)
  - Stakes: permadeath run; Gyarados at a sliver; resource calculus telegraphs MC's mindset.
  - Inciting incident: Discord pings; "Shadow Mewtwo at library gym"; sprint and impact.
- Awakening (Tank + Caretaker)
  - Wrong-sized body sensations; caretaker wraps/protects; Amber name applied to POV body before acceptance.
  - Identity delay: refer to caretaker as unnamed until recognition cues align with Dr. Fuji.
- Lab Chaos (Mewtwo + Evacuation)
  - Psychic pressure, Arcanine strike, moonlight exit; structural collapse; caretaker prioritizes Amber's safety.

## Canon References (for context)
- Amber (Ai), Dr. Fuji's deceased daughter; cloning attempt "Ambertwo" befriends nascent Mewtwo during incubation; early clones fail.
  - Source: [Amber (anime) — Bulbapedia](https://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/Amber_(anime))
  - Source: [The Uncut Story of Mewtwo's Origin — Bulbapedia](https://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/The_Uncut_Story_of_Mewtwo%27s_Origin)
- Memory suppression for Mewtwo after early-clone loss; English materials imply residual feelings.

## Headcanon (Story Direction)
- The original Ambertwo fails as in canon; Dr. Fuji persists and eventually achieves a viable clone body.
- The isekai event coincides with viability: MC's arrival "completes" Amber at the moment Mewtwo awakens.
- Mewtwo's flash of recognition arises from suppressed-but-residual imprinting; this inhibits total annihilation.

## Reader Experience Goals
- Feel the snap from mundane stakes to cosmic stakes.
- Experience disorientation in the new body without losing agency.
- Sense the caretaker's love/obsession before labeling him as Dr. Fuji.

## Easter Eggs / Signals
- Truck impact as meta nod to isekai.
- 8-bit mansion descriptions echo Kanto canon while framing modern voice.
- Early "Amber" naming without POV acceptance seeds identity tension.

## Editorial Review (Chapter 1)
- Voice: conversational, precise, game-literate; good balance of humor and dread.
- Pacing: tighter post-edit; recognition timing for Fuji improved by delaying the name.
- Style: standardized em dashes as `---`; consistent ASCII ellipses `...`.
- Risks: keep pronoun/identity clarity as story progresses; preserve POV-knowledge boundaries when naming.
