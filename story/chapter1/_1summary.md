# Chapter 1 - Summary

An adult from another world dies during a Shadow Mewtwo raid alert and awakens as Amber Fuji in a clone tank amid Mewtwo's escape; Dr. Fuji rescues her.

- Story: [Chapter 1](./chapter1.md)

## What happens:
### 1. Old World Demise:
*   The unnamed protagonist is engrossed in a *Pokemon Nuzlocke* run, battling a Vulpix on their phone.
*   A Discord notification alerts them to an urgent *Shadow Mewtwo* raid, diverting their attention.
*   They rush out, disregard a traffic signal, and are fatally struck by a truck on University Avenue, ending their old life abruptly.

### 2. Awakening and Discovery:
*   Consciousness returns in a thick, amber fluid within a container; the protagonist has no memory of how they got there and questions their state of being.
*   The container shatters, and a middle-aged man (later identified as Dr. Fuji) catches them, expressing relief and calling them "Amber."
*   The protagonist discovers their voice is young and high-pitched, and observes a real Mewtwo causing havoc in the laboratory.

### 3. Escape and Revelation:
*   Mewtwo makes eye contact with Amber, and a fleeting connection is perceived before an Arcanine's attack. Mewtwo then blasts through the ceiling and escapes.
*   Amidst alarms and structural chaos, Amber connects the dots: Mewtwo, a laboratory, and the man she realizes is Dr. Fuji.
*   Dr. Fuji confirms Amber is his daughter, vows to "fix it all," and carries her through the burning facility, past other destroyed clone tanks, into a lavish mansion.
*   Amber notices Dr. Fuji's injuries (blood seeping through his suit), but he remains focused on her escape.

## Potential speculation:
*   **Isekai Trope:** The protagonist's death and rebirth as Amber Fuji strongly align with the *isekai* genre, suggesting a pre-ordained role or significant purpose for her in this new Pokemon world.
*   **Mewtwo Connection:** The eye contact and perceived connection between Mewtwo and Amber could imply a shared origin or a deep psychic link, possibly due to Amber's clone nature or a deeper, unknown bond.
*   **Dr. Fuji's Motives:** Dr. Fuji's desperation to "fix it all" and his focus on Amber hint at profound grief over the original Amber's loss, and he might view the new Amber as a means to atone for past failures or achieve an idealized family.
*   **Cloning Program Scope:** The presence of other shattered clone tanks and a glitching Kadabra variant suggests that Dr. Fuji's research extends beyond Mewtwo and Amber, potentially involving a larger-scale cloning program with other escaped or unstable creations.
*   **Covert Operations:** The transition from a sterile lab to a lavish mansion interior, combined with the clandestine nature of the facility, implies that Dr. Fuji's work is either secretly funded by a powerful organization (like Team Rocket, as later revealed) or backed by his own substantial resources, raising questions about the ethics and reach of his scientific endeavors.
