This article details the known geographical locations, environments, and key settlements featured in *Pokemon: Ambertwo*. The Kanto region depicted is one of stark contrasts, from bustling, technologically advanced cities to isolated, rural towns still bearing the cultural scars of the [[History of the World (Pre-Story)#The Great Unification War | Great Unification War]].

## Kanto Region

The primary setting of the story. This version of Kanto is more fragmented than in other depictions. While major cities are connected by advanced transport like the [[#Pidgeot Express | Pidgeot Express]], the routes between them are dangerous and information does not flow freely. This has led to a culture of regional isolation, where cities develop unique economies and social structures, and rural towns can feel like they exist in a different era entirely.

### Key Cities and Towns

#### **Celadon City**
A massive, sprawling metropolis that serves as one of Kanto's primary economic hubs. It is a city of extreme wealth and poverty, with distinct districts that rarely interact.
*   **Commercial District:** The glittering heart of the city, home to the massive **Celadon Department Store** and numerous high-end boutiques. This is the public face of Celadon's prosperity.
*   **Celadon Gym & Gardens:** A prestigious institution that is more than just a battle facility. It operates as a major research and development center, particularly for its proprietary line of Pokémon supplements like HP UP. The gym grounds are vast, containing numerous training fields and specialized greenhouses.
*   **Game Corner District:** A neon-soaked area dedicated to entertainment and gambling. It is widely known to be a hub of criminal activity and serves as a public front for [[Team Rocket]]'s operations in the city.
*   **Factory Ward:** An impoverished and heavily polluted industrial sector. It is characterized by decaying infrastructure, poor living conditions, and unique health crises like "Sludge Fever," which are largely ignored by the rest of the city.

#### **Pallet Town**
A small, quiet, and geographically isolated town on the southern coast of Kanto. It is primarily a residential community, known for its peaceful atmosphere and close-knit population.
*   **Professor Oak's Laboratory:** The town's most prominent landmark. Perched on a hill overlooking the town, it is a world-renowned research facility headed by the former Kanto Champion, [[Professor Samuel Oak]].
*   **Ketchum Residence:** The home of the [[Delia Ketchum | Ketchum family]]. Before its destruction, it represented the peaceful, domestic life that many sought in the aftermath of the war.

#### **Cinnabar Island**
A volcanic island that was once a hub for cutting-edge, and often ethically questionable, scientific research.
*   **Cinnabar Lab:** The secret [[Team Rocket]] facility where [[Dr. Fuji]] conducted his cloning experiments. It was the "birthplace" of [[Mewtwo]] and the protagonist's clone body. The lab was destroyed by Mewtwo upon its escape at the beginning of the story.

### Transportation and Infrastructure

*   **Pidgeot Express:** A commercial airline service that uses teams of highly trained Pidgeot for rapid, long-distance travel between major cities. This service is essential for connecting the otherwise isolated population centers of Kanto.
*   **Celadon Metro:** A local train network serving Celadon City and its immediate surroundings. It is a key piece of public infrastructure for the massive city.
*   **Roads & Vehicles:** While major roads exist, personal vehicles are a rarity and appear to be based on older, mid-20th-century technology. They are not the primary mode of transport for the general populace, who rely more on public transit and Pokémon.
