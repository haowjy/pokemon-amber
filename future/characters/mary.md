# Mary (Pewter Gym Trainer)

**Reappearing character from Chapter 7 - relationship status TBD**

## Basic Profile

- **Age:** 15-16
- **Role:** "Late bloomer" restarting journey
- **Specialty:** Rock-type specialist
- **Personality:** Practical, grounded, older sister figure

## Background

- Worked as Pewter gym trainer (Chapter 7)
- Finally earned Boulder Badge
- Restarting journey after delayed start
- Carries "behind peers" shame (late bloomer)

## Possible Relationship Types

**Traveling companion:**
- Journey together for extended period
- Mutual support and growth
- Found family dynamic

**Friendly rival:**
- Compete for badges/achievements
- Push each other to improve
- Respect without dependency

**Ally/recurring friend:**
- Cross paths periodically
- Help each other when needed
- Independent journeys that intersect

**Mentor figure:**
- Mary teaches Amber survival skills
- Brief mentorship then diverge
- Amber applies lessons independently

**Status:** Undecided - could be any of the above depending on story needs

## Character Function (If Companion)

### For Amber
- Teaches survival skills Amber lacks
- Older sister dynamic (protective but not parental)
- Represents accepting help from peers
- Ground-type knowledge complements team

### For Story
- Pragmatic voice in group decisions
- Has gym training background (competent battler)
- Understands trainer economics (worked for money)
- Connection to Pewter/Brock (story threading)

## Found Family Dynamic

**Mary's outsider status:**
- "Behind" peers (started late, peers already have 3-4 badges)
- Working-class background (had to work at gym first)
- Not naturally talented, had to earn everything
- Feels pressure to catch up

**Parallel to Amber:**
- Both feel like they don't belong
- Both hyper-independent (Mary from necessity, Amber from trauma)
- Both hide insecurities
- Both need to learn accepting help is okay

## Potential Story Beats

### How They Meet Again
- Amber encounters Mary on Route (post-Pewter or Viridian area)
- Mary recognizes Amber from Chapter 7
- Initially travel separately, keep running into each other
- Gradually become travel companions

### Character Arc
- Starts defensive about late start
- Learns her experience (gym work, life skills) is valuable
- Mentors Amber in practical survival
- Finds confidence in own path vs. comparing to peers

## Relationship Dynamics

### With Amber
- Protective but respects Amber's agency
- Puzzled by Amber's adult-like thinking
- Doesn't push for personal details
- Teaches through showing, not lecturing

### With Sabrina (if included)
- Practical vs. powerful
- Mary feels outclassed by Sabrina's raw talent
- But Mary's groundedness helps Sabrina stay connected
- Rock-type training vs. psychic specialization

## Open Questions

1. **Include Mary or not?** (vs. different character, or Amber stays solo longer)
2. **What relationship type?** (Companion, rival, ally, mentor)
3. **When does she reappear?** (Early journey vs. after Amber has some experience)
4. **How long do they interact?** (Entire journey vs. arc-specific vs. brief encounters)
5. **What's her personal goal?** (Catch up to peers? Prove herself? Different dream?)
6. **Does she know Amber's secret?** (Never, eventually, senses something's off?)
