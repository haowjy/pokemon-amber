# Open Questions to Decide Later

**Decision points that don't need resolution yet but should be tracked**

---

## Major Structural Decisions

### 1. Commit to time loop or not?
**Affects:** Oak's role, long-term structure, thematic complexity

**Options:**
- Time loop (Pokemon 4Ever Celebi encounter)
- Instinct/trust (no supernatural justification)
- Hybrid approach (loop exists but not central)

**Related:** `plot/oak-role-options.md`, `arcs/pokemon-4ever-option.md`

**Urgency:** Need to decide before Arc 2-3 planning

---

### 2. Which Route 1 companion Pokemon?
**Affects:** Team composition, thematic resonance, battle style

**Options:**
- Cubone (orphan parallel, grief symbolism, masks theme)
- Eevee (evolution/choice theme, adaptability)
- Meowth (scrappy survivor, Pay Day economics)
- Trapinch (could be second instead of third)
- Other rare/unexpected encounter

**Related:** `characters/route1-pokemon.md`, `episodes/trapinch-rescue.md`

**Urgency:** Need to decide before writing Route 1 survival chapters

---

### 3. Mary and/or Sabrina as companions?
**Affects:** Found family dynamic, group composition, plot capabilities

**Options:**
- Mary only (grounded, practical, older sister)
- Sabrina only (powerful, mysterious, tension)
- Both (three misfits, full found family)
- Neither (different companions or solo longer)
- One now, one later

**Related:** `characters/mary-companion.md`, `characters/sabrina-companion.md`

**Urgency:** Mary could appear early (Arc 1), Sabrina likely later

---

## Plot Thread Decisions

### 4. How much does Sabrina sense?
**Affects:** Discovery timeline, tension level, relationship dynamic

**Options:**
- Vague wrongness (never identifies specific)
- Gradually understands more (puzzle pieces)
- Full discovery (at specific plot point)
- Never quite figures it out

**Related:** `characters/sabrina-companion.md`

**Urgency:** Need to decide before Sabrina's introduction

---

### 5. Oak's exact approach to tracking Amber?
**Affects:** How much safety net exists, independence authenticity

**Options:**
- Tracks from distance (Dragonite flyovers)
- Lets her go completely (respects agency)
- Intervenes at specific crisis points
- Counter-surveilling Team Rocket

**Related:** `plot/oak-role-options.md`, `plot/team-rocket-surveillance.md`

**Urgency:** Impacts Arc 1 stakes and Oak's characterization

---

### 6. Team Rocket introduction timing?
**Affects:** Threat escalation pace, paranoia elements

**Options:**
- Early threat (Trapinch episode, Arc 1 end)
- Later reveal (Arc 2 primary antagonist)
- Gradual escalation (surveillance → testing → pursuit)
- Multiple phases with gaps

**Related:** `plot/team-rocket-surveillance.md`, `episodes/trapinch-rescue.md`

**Urgency:** Affects Arc 1 planning

---

## Character Arc Decisions

### 7. Badge pursuit approach?
**Affects:** Story pacing, achievement milestones, travel route

**Options:**
- Traditional badge quest (8 gyms, Conference goal)
- Survival focus (badges secondary)
- Mixed (some gyms for practical reasons, not collecting)
- Avoid gyms entirely (rebel path)

**Related:** `arcs/arc1-survival.md`, worldbuilding lore

**Urgency:** Low - can decide organically during writing

---

### 8. Delia resolution?
**Affects:** Emotional closure, Pallet connections, forgiveness themes

**Options:**
- Eventual reconciliation (years later, mutual growth)
- Permanent rift (some wounds don't heal)
- Oak mediates (but damage remains)
- Delia reaches out first
- Amber reaches out first
- Never addressed on-page

**Related:** `plot/forged-documents.md`

**Urgency:** Low - not relevant until late Arc 2 or Arc 3

---

### 9. Post-war orphan context in Chapter 17?
**Affects:** Worldbuilding depth, Amber's circumstances normalization

**Options:**
- Add explicit mention (Oak notes orphan crisis)
- Leave implied (readers infer from context)
- Address later in journey (Amber encounters other orphans)

**Related:** Chapter 17 revisions (if reopening)

**Urgency:** Very low - Chapter 17 is complete, only matters if revising
