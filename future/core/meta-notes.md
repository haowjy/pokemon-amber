# Meta Notes for Story Direction

## Writing Principles

- The identity/creation theme is the strongest element
- Don't let canon crossovers overshadow original story
- Amber's agency must be preserved (avoid over-reliance on support)
- Survival stakes create compelling narrative tension
- Ditto is narrative mirror, not comic relief
- On-screen discovery is Path A's greatest strength
- Keep creative flexibility - these are directions, not rigid plans

## Story Balance

**Prioritize:**
- Character growth through experience
- Emotional authenticity
- World-building through action/discovery
- Theme exploration through plot

**Avoid:**
- Over-plotting future chapters
- Explaining too much too soon
- Removing stakes with convenient help
- Making Amber too competent too fast

## Planning Philosophy

These notes are:
- **Directions, not mandates** - story can evolve
- **Ideas to explore** - not all need to be used
- **Flexible frameworks** - specifics decided during writing

Keep room for:
- Organic character moments
- Unexpected story developments
- Better ideas that emerge during drafting
