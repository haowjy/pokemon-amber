# Path A: Age 10 Departure (Real-Time Journey)

**CONFIRMED** - The story will follow Amber's journey starting at age 10, experiencing the Pokemon world in real-time rather than time-skipping.

## Why This Works

- Readers discover the world WITH Amber (on-screen learning)
- Adult mind + child body tension maintained
- Survival stakes create compelling narrative
- Character growth shown, not told
- Found family formation happens organically
- Economic/practical realities of trainer life explored

## Key Beats Confirmed

1. **~1 month at Pallet** (post-Chapter 17) - tension building with Delia
2. **Forged documents revelation** - Delia listed as legal guardian without consent
3. **Stephen's funeral** - Delia's breakdown, rejects Amber publicly
4. **Amber runs away** - can't stay where she causes suffering
5. **Route 1 survival** - alone in wilderness, learning harsh realities
6. **Viridian Trainer License** - passes standard exam at age 10 (rare but legal)

## Trainer License System

- **1 Pokemon = right** (no license required, constitutional/cultural right)
- **2-6 Pokemon = Trainer License** (single standard exam, all ages)
- Amber flees with just Ditto (legal, no paperwork needed)
- Needs license to build actual team (catch Cubone, others)
- Age 10 license is unusual (most are 13-15) but explained by adult mind + strong Ditto
- Exam difficulty: written component, knowledge assessment, practical battle
- For details see: wiki/lore/trainer-systems/trainer-licensing.md

## Core Character Arc

- Starts hyper-independent (trauma response: "I can't burden anyone")
- Journey teaches her: accepting help = strength, not weakness
- Learns to rely on Pokemon, friends, and community
- Found family through choice, not obligation
