# Route 1 Companion Pokemon

**Second Pokemon acquired during early survival period**

## Context & Timing

- Encountered during Route 1 survival phase
- After fleeing Pallet, before Viridian license
- Bonds through shared struggle/survival
- Officially caught with first free pokeball from license exam

## Option 1: Cubone (Thematic Favorite)

### Symbolism
- **Orphan parallel:** Both lost their mothers
- **Grief symbolism:** Cubone wears mother's skull, Amber mourns old life
- **Masks:** All three wear masks (Ditto transforms, Cubone's skull, Amber hides mind)
- **Found family through shared trauma**

### Practical Utility
- Ground-type (good type coverage with Ditto)
- Defensive fighter (complements Amber's cautious style)
- Bone Club/Bonemerang as signature moves
- Future evolution to Marowak (growth parallel)

### Character Function
- Visual metaphor for grief and survival
- Another "outsider" Pokemon
- Loyal to point of overprotectiveness
- Struggles with loss (mirrors Amber)

### How They Meet
- Competing for berries/resources
- Mutual recognition of shared loneliness
- Cubone defends injured Amber from wild Pokemon
- Gradual bonding through survival necessity

### Risks
- Too on-the-nose thematically?
- Cubone's grief might overshadow Amber's
- Potentially too "sad" for team dynamic

## Option 2: Eevee

### Symbolism
- **Evolution/potential:** Mirrors identity questions
- **Choice:** Which evolution reflects who you choose to be?
- **Adaptability:** Survives by being flexible (like Amber)

### Practical Utility
- High potential, multiple evolution paths
- Versatile moveset
- Eventually evolution = character growth moment
- Popular/recognizable Pokemon

### Character Function
- Represents unlimited potential
- Choice of evolution = thematic payoff
- Scrappy survivor type
- Optimistic contrast to Amber's caution

### How They Meet
- Abandoned by trainer (too common, wanted rarer Pokemon)
- Found injured/starving
- Bonds quickly due to friendly nature
- Chooses Amber as much as Amber chooses it

### Risks
- Eevee is very common in fanfic
- Evolution choice might feel forced/symbolic
- Less immediate emotional hook than Cubone

## Option 3: Meowth

### Symbolism
- **Scrappy survivor:** Streetwise, resourceful
- **Communication themes:** Learns human speech eventually?
- **Class commentary:** Often associated with poverty/survival

### Practical Utility
- Pay Day (money generation = addresses economic reality)
- Clever/strategic fighter
- Good with urban environments
- Evolution to Persian (intimidating, competent)

### Character Function
- Teaches Amber street smarts
- Comic relief potential
- Practical survivor mindset
- Economic utility (Pay Day helps with pokeball costs)

### How They Meet
- Both scavenging same location
- Initial rivalry → respect → partnership
- Meowth sees Amber as useful ally
- Relationship starts transactional, becomes genuine

### Risks
- Team Rocket association (Giovanni has Persian)
- Might feel too comedic
- Pay Day could trivialize economic struggles

## Option 4: Something Rare/Unexpected

### Concept
- Stumbled off-route into unusual habitat
- Wrong region Pokemon (Hoenn/Sinnoh species)
- Unusual circumstances (migration, escaped from trainer, etc.)

### Examples
- Aron (wrong region, but thematic - steel/armor = protection)
- Ralts (psychic bond, eventual Gardevoir/Gallade)
- Trapinch (see `episodes/trapinch-rescue.md` - could be third Pokemon instead)

### Risks
- Harder to justify presence
- Might feel contrived
- Less thematic resonance

## Acquisition Scenario (General)

1. **Competition for resources:** Berries, water, shelter
2. **Mutual recognition:** Both alone, both surviving
3. **Shared danger:** Wild Pokemon attack, weather event
4. **Gradual bonding:** Days/week of parallel survival
5. **Decision point:** Pokemon defends Amber when injured
6. **Partnership:** Amber promises to catch it officially once she has pokeball

## Team Composition Considerations

**With Cubone:**
- Ditto (transform/versatile) + Cubone (defensive/ground)
- Strong defensive core
- Thematic unity (all three wear masks/hide)
- Later: add offensive/fast Pokemon for balance

**With Eevee:**
- Ditto (transform) + Eevee (potential)
- Extremely flexible team
- Evolution choice becomes major character moment
- Later: specialize based on Eevee evolution

**With Meowth:**
- Ditto (versatile) + Meowth (clever/scrappy)
- Practical survival team
- Pay Day addresses economic reality
- Later: add power/type coverage

## Open Questions

1. **Which Pokemon?** (Cubone, Eevee, Meowth, other?)
2. **When exactly?** (During Route 1 survival vs. after Viridian)
3. **How fast do they bond?** (Immediate vs. gradual over days/weeks)
4. **Personality?** (Matches Amber's caution vs. contrasts with optimism)
5. **Evolution timing?** (If applicable - when and what triggers it)
