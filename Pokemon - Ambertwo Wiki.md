# Pokemon: Ambertwo Wiki

Welcome to the main portal for **Pokemon: Ambertwo**, a dark re-imagining of the Pokémon world. Set in a version of [[Geography and Environment#Kanto Region | Kanto]] scarred by a recent war and defined by localized information, this story follows the journey of a 20-year-old woman from our world whose consciousness is violently transferred into the body of a 10-year-old clone.

This wiki documents a world where Pokémon battles are brutal and often lethal, the lines between scientific genius and monstrous obsession have blurred, and familiar heroes are caught in a web of tragedy they never knew existed. The narrative explores themes of identity, trauma, and the consequences of refusing to let go of the past.

## Plot Summary

*(See main article: [[Plot Progression of Ambertwo]])*

The story is divided into several distinct acts, each marking a significant shift in the protagonist's journey and the escalating conflict.

### **Act 1: Rebirth and Reality (Chapters 1-5)**

The story begins with the protagonist's death and sudden awakening in a cloning tank on [[Geography and Environment#Cinnabar Island | Cinnabar Island]]. She finds herself inhabiting the body of **[[Amber (Protagonist) | Amber]]**, a clone of the deceased daughter of the brilliant but unstable scientist, **[[Dr. Fuji]]**. Her awakening coincides with the violent escape of [[Mewtwo]], a powerful Pokémon created in the same lab. Believing his daughter is truly resurrected, Dr. Fuji escapes the collapsing facility with Amber and his guardian **[[Ditto]]**. They relocate to [[Geography and Environment#Celadon City | Celadon City]], where Amber, struggling with her new reality, makes her first bid for freedom, culminating in her first real Pokémon battle and an exploration of the [[Celadon Gym]].

### **Act 2: The Celadon City Investigation (Chapters 6-10)**

While Amber grapples with her new life, the narrative reveals Dr. Fuji's connection to [[Team Rocket]] and his ongoing obsession with his ex-wife, **[[Delia Ketchum]]**. Amber becomes the prime suspect in the theft of an [[Oddish]] from the Celadon Gym. To clear her name, she works alongside the ambitious gym trainer **[[Mary]]** and the acting leader **[[Erika]]**. The investigation uncovers a desperate plot by a young girl, **[[Kaede]]**, to save her ailing brother. After solving the mystery, Amber's brief taste of independence is cut short when she is forcibly captured by a furious Dr. Fuji.

### **Act 3: The Pallet Town Inferno (Chapters 11-16)**

The story's tone shifts dramatically to horror. Dr. Fuji takes Amber to the peaceful community of [[Geography and Environment#Pallet Town | Pallet Town]] to confront Delia. There, the full tragedy of the past is revealed: Delia has built a new life with the war veteran **[[Stephen Ketchum]]** and their son, **[[Ash Ketchum]]**. After a violent confrontation, Fuji murders Stephen in cold blood. He later returns to the Ketchum home, burning it to the ground in an attempt to "reclaim" his family. A brutal battle ensues between Stephen's partner **[[Electabuzz]]** and Fuji's **[[Magmar]]**, ending in Electabuzz's horrific death. The timely arrival of **[[Professor Samuel Oak]]** prevents further tragedy, leading to a high-stakes battle between the two scientists that devastates the neighborhood.
