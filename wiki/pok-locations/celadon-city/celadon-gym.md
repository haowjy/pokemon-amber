## Overview

**Staff:** 30+ trainers plus administrative and security personnel

## Location & Grounds

### Exterior Approach

**Ginkgo Tree Avenue:**
The main path to the gym is lined with mature ginkgo trees whose fan-shaped leaves create a golden canopy, especially dramatic during autumn. The avenue features:
- Carefully planned landscaping transitioning from natural to modern aesthetic
- Raised garden beds with Oddish-shaped topiaries
- Stunning arrays of irises and wisteria
- Small decorative pond reflecting sunlight
- Park benches between trees (some occupied by questionable individuals) ([Chapter 5](../../../story/chapter5/chapter5.md))

**Main Building:**
"The building ahead grew more imposing with each step, glass and steel rising up behind the ancient trees in a way that should have felt jarring but somehow worked." ([Chapter 5](../../../story/chapter5/chapter5.md))

Modern architecture incorporating:
- Glass and steel construction
- Automatic doors
- Climate-controlled interior
- Fluorescent lighting (transitioning from filtered natural light outside)
- Sleek reception desk with posted price board

**Training Facilities:**
Multiple areas revealed when Mary escorts Amber through the complex ([Chapter 8](../../../story/chapter8/chapter8.md)):
- "Indoor grass field battling rings stretched out in vast chambers, their floors marked with the scars of countless showdowns"
- One room with Victreebel demonstrating "high-speed vine technique" to students
- Another with trainer and Tangrowth in "intense sparring match involving strategic retreating"
- Multiple specialized training chambers

**Maintenance Corridors:**
"Maintenance corridors and back passages where the polished presentation gave way to practical necessity":
- Break room with Bellsprout operating coffee maker
- Storage area smelling of fertilizer
- Staff-only passages connecting facilities

**Security Office:**
"A door that looked like it had started life as a supply closet before getting promoted beyond its qualifications":
- Small plaque reading "Security"
- Cramped space with multiple screens showing key gym areas
- Tangela operating main console, managing camera feeds
- Security footage of greenhouse and other facilities
- Drowsy staff (Kayla works here) ([Chapter 8](../../../story/chapter8/chapter8.md))

### Greenhouse Complex

**Restricted Facility:**
Located in the gym gardens, away from main building through winding paths. Surrounded by azaleas and accessible via high-handled door.

**Interior Environment:**
"A wave of warm, humid air carried the rich scent of earth and growing things" ([Chapter 5](../../../story/chapter5/chapter5.md))
- Humid, warm atmosphere
- Paths winding between ferns and berry plants
- Large pots and planting beds
- Green-tinted shadows from filtered sunlight
- "Reality was messier, less orderly than pixel versions" - plants overlapping and intertwining

**Signage:**
"RESTRICTED - DO NOT ENTER" sign mounted above child-height on greenhouse wall (which Amber missed) ([Chapter 5](../../../story/chapter5/chapter5.md))

**Resident Pokemon:**
- Gloom (waddled out to meet Amber, "smaller than expected, barely coming up to waist height")
- Oddish (stolen specimen, subject of investigation in Chapters 7-8)
- Vileplume (chased thief during theft)
- Combee (flying Pokemon, part of greenhouse ecosystem)
- Parasect (pursued thief)

## Recent Events

### The Oddish Theft (Chapters 7-8)

**Incident:**
An Oddish was stolen from the restricted greenhouse, triggering investigation.

**Timeline:**
1. Amber enters greenhouse innocently ([Chapter 5](../../../story/chapter5/chapter5.md))
2. Mary catches Amber, escorting her out
3. Shortly after, thief steals Oddish while greenhouse Pokemon chase her
4. Mary posts WANTED notices at Pokemon Center ([Chapter 7](../../../story/chapter7/chapter7.md))
5. Mary recognizes Amber at Pokemon Center, brings her in for questioning
6. Security footage reviewed showing both Amber and real thief ([Chapter 8](../../../story/chapter8/chapter8.md))
7. Amber identifies thief using Ditto's transformation ability
8. Investigation continues under Erika's direction

**Thief Description (from footage):**
- Much older than Amber
- "Practically sprinting through greenhouse"
- One hand clutching Oddish, other pressed against face
- "Randomly pulling her head back and forth" (appearing to sneeze)
- Allergic reaction visible even in grainy footage

**Theory (Erika):**
"The spores from Oddish are known to be a key ingredient in HP UP formula. Someone might have stolen it to try and reverse engineer our recipe" ([Chapter 8](../../../story/chapter8/chapter8.md))

**Complications:**
- Kayla nearly reveals they don't actually use Oddish anymore for HP UP
- Amber's presence creates suspicion of distraction tactic
- Corporate espionage suspected

## Research Operations

### HP UP Production

Gym conducts proprietary research on healing item production:
- HP UP formula (healing potion)
- Previously used Oddish spores (no longer current formula)
- Formula secrecy maintained for competitive advantage
- Potential commercial/corporate implications

**Erika's Strategic Thinking:**
"We should check the item shops, see if anyone's selling unauthorized HP UP-or better yet, have the shops keep us updated on any information about new HP UP formulas. This could be the opportunity I need to advance my claim." ([Chapter 8](../../../story/chapter8/chapter8.md))

Suggests competitive market for healing item formulas among gyms or corporations.

### Greenhouse Functions

Multiple purposes beyond display:
- Pokemon habitat and care
- Berry and plant cultivation
- Research specimen maintenance
- Training environment
- Formula ingredient sourcing (historically)
