# Cinnabar Island

[Bulbapedia](https://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/Cinnabar_Island)

## Overview

Cinnabar Island is a large volcanic island located off the southern coast of Kanto, directly south of Pallet Town. The island is dominated by an active volcano on its western side and is known for its geothermally heated hot springs, unique Fire-type Pokemon populations, and Blaine's Fire-type Pokemon Gym.

Originally developed for its fertile volcanic soil and valuable timber resources (particularly fire-resistant Ember Tree wood), Cinnabar has transitioned over the past several decades into a tourism-focused economy. The island attracts visitors for its volcano tours, hot springs, beaches, and the challenge of Blaine's gym. A small but dedicated agricultural sector persists despite the economic shift toward hospitality services.

The island's primary settlement includes the Pokemon Center, various hotels and tourist accommodations, the Pokemon Gym, ferry terminal, and Pidgeot Express flight services connecting to mainland Kanto. The Flame Forest wilderness area occupies significant portions of the island's interior and is known for both its biodiversity and considerable danger to inexperienced trainers.
