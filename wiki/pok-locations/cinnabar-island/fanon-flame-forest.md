# Flame Forest (Fanon)

## Overview
Flame Forest is a diverse wilderness area on Cinnabar Island, characterized by its mixed ecosystem of Fire, Water, and Grass-type Pokemon. Despite its name, the forest supports a wide variety of Pokemon types due to the island's unique combination of volcanic soil fertility and regular rainfall. The area is known both for its natural beauty and significant dangers, particularly the territorial Skarmory population that patrols its canopy.

## Geography & Ecology

### Terrain
The forest features dense vegetation interspersed with geothermal vents and natural hot springs. Rocky clearings near volcanic activity create temperature gradients throughout the area, with some zones reaching extreme heat while interior sections remain relatively cool. Natural streams fed by mountain runoff provide water sources that support aquatic Pokemon populations.

### Ember Trees
The forest's most notable feature is the presence of Ember Trees, a rare old-growth species with naturally fire-resistant properties. These trees create microclimate zones of increased fire resistance in their immediate vicinity and serve as critical habitat for Grass-type Pokemon seeking protection from Fire-type predators. Skarmory preferentially nest in the largest and oldest Ember Trees, likely due to their resistance to fire-based attacks.

Ember Trees are extremely slow-growing, requiring decades to reach maturity. Attempts to cultivate them commercially have largely failed, making naturally occurring specimens increasingly rare and valuable.

## Pokemon Populations

### Common Species by Zone

**Hot Zones (near geothermal vents):**
- Magby/Magmar, Growlithe, Vulpix, Ponyta/Rapidash, Slugma/Magcargo
- Skarmory (nesting in fire-resistant trees at zone edges)

**Forest Interior:**
- Oddish/Gloom, Bellsprout/Weepinbell, Tangela, Exeggcute/Exeggutor
- Rattata/Raticate, Spearow/Fearow

**Water Sources:**
- Poliwag/Poliwhirl, Psyduck/Golduck, Goldeen/Seaking, Lotad/Ludicolo

**Cave System:**
- Zubat/Golbat, Geodude/Graveler, Onix, Sandshrew/Sandslash
- MagbyMagmar, Magcargo (deeper sections with higher temperatures)

### Territorial Behavior
Skarmory are the area's most significant threat to human visitors. These Steel/Flying-type Pokemon patrol the forest canopy year-round, becoming especially aggressive during nesting season. Their razor-sharp wings can inflict serious injuries, and their aerial advantage makes them difficult to evade or counter. Unlike ground-based Fire-types whose territories can be avoided with proper route planning, Skarmory patrols cover the entire forest airspace.

Magmar populations near geothermal vents also pose significant danger due to their territorial nature and extremely high body temperatures.

## Human Activity

### Trainer Visits
Despite its dangers, Flame Forest attracts steady trainer traffic for several reasons:
- **Fire Stone hunting:** The volcanic environment produces natural Fire Stone formations
- **Pokemon capture:** Particularly Growlithe and Vulpix, popular choices and valuable, particularly Vulpix, who are rare and valuable elsewhere.
- **Training grounds:** Higher-level wild Pokemon provide experience for serious trainers
- **Gym preparation:** Local tradition suggests testing oneself in Flame Forest before challenging Blaine's gym

### Resource Extraction

**Historical Context:**
Cinnabar Island experienced significant deforestation during its early settlement period, with Ember Tree wood particularly prized for its fire-resistant properties. Ancient buildings throughout Cinnabar, including portions of the Pokemon Gym, were constructed using Ember Tree lumber. As settlement expanded and agriculture developed (taking advantage of the island's exceptionally fertile volcanic soil), demand for cleared land accelerated forest loss.

**Current Status:**
The combination of increased settlement, tourism growth, and recognition of ecological damage led to protective legislation. Cutting Ember Trees is now illegal, with violations triggering aggressive defensive responses from the forest's wild Pokemon populationâ€”particularly Skarmory and the Grass-types that depend on Ember Trees for habitat.

Small-scale cultivation attempts continue but have achieved limited success due to the species' extremely slow growth rate and poorly understood germination requirements. The shift from agriculture to tourism-based economy (mirroring broader trends in island development) has reduced pressure for land clearing, though illegal poaching of valuable Ember Tree wood still occurs.

**Modern Industry:**
Legal timber operations harvest non-Ember species from designated safe zones, typically employing teams of trainers with Flying-type Pokemon for transport and protection. Individual poachers occasionally target Ember Trees despite legal prohibitions and significant personal risk.

## Safety Warnings
The Cinnabar Island Pokemon Center and local authorities strongly discourage inexperienced trainers from entering Flame Forest. Common dangers include:
- Skarmory aerial attacks (year-round threat)
- Territorial Fire-type confrontations near hot zones
- Geothermal hazards (scalding water, superheated steam vents)
- Navigation difficulties in dense interior sections
- Cave system risks (toxic gas pockets, structural instability)

Visitors are advised to travel in groups, maintain Flying-type Pokemon capable of emergency evacuation, and avoid areas near visible Skarmory nests.

## Notes
The forest's name is somewhat misleading given its ecological diversity, but reflects early settler focus on the area's Fire-type population and frequent fire hazards from wild Pokemon battles.
