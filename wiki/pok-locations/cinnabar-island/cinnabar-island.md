# Cinnibar Island

[Bulbapedia](https://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/Cinnabar_Island)

## Overview

Cinnabar Island is a large island located off the southern coast of the Kanto region, south of Pallet Town. It is home to a large volcano. Blaine was once the resident Gym Leader specializing in Fire-type Pokémon, but in the Johto-based games, Cinnabar Island had been ravaged by a volcanic eruption and Blaine has moved the Cinnabar Gym to the Seafoam Islands.

## Volcano (Canon)

There is a volcano on Cinnabar Island which gives it its name. In Generation I and III, no volcano is visible on the island, but in Generation VII, the volcano is on the western side, near the Cinnabar Lab and Pokémon Mansion.

In Generation II and IV, the volcano has erupted on the island, destroying everything with only the Pokémon Center being rebuilt. In these games, the player can actually see the volcano itself.

## Cinnabar Gym (Canon)

The Cinnabar Gym is the official Gym of Cinnabar Island in Generations I, III, and VII. it is based on Fire-type Pokémon and the Gym Leader is Blaine. Trainers who defeat him receive the Volcano Badge. The player is unable to enter the Gym at once; only when they obtain the Secret Key from the Pokémon Mansion can they unlock the door to the Gym.

It was relocated to the Seafoam Islands following the volcanic eruption in Generation II and IV.

## Pokémon Mansion (Canon)

The Pokémon Mansion is a decrepit, burned-down mansion on Cinnabar Island. It got its name because a famous Pokémon researcher once lived there. To access the Cinnabar Island Gym in Generations I, III, and VII, the player has to enter the mansion and find the Secret Key to unlock the door of the Gym. Many Burglars come to the mansion, trying to steal valuable items that may have been lost in the wreckage. Several journal entries can be found around the mansion, describing the discovery of Mew and the creation of Mewtwo.

It has been destroyed as a result of a volcanic eruption by the time of Generation II and Generation IV.

## Flame Forest (Non‑canon)

[Flame Forest (full article)](./flame-forest.md)

Flame Forest is a wilderness area on Cinnabar Island characterized by mixed terrain including dense forest, geothermal vents, natural hot springs, and cave systems. The area's fertile volcanic soil and regular rainfall support a diverse ecosystem of Fire, Water, and Grass-type Pokémon.

The forest is particularly dangerous due to territorial Skarmory that nest in the canopy and patrol the airspace year-round. Trainers visit primarily to hunt for naturally-forming Fire Stones and to catch Fire-type Pokémon in preparation for Blaine's Gym challenge. The forest also contains rare Ember Trees—slow-growing, fire-resistant specimens now legally protected after historical over-harvesting. Ancient buildings throughout Cinnabar were constructed using Ember Tree lumber.

### Wild Pokémon
**Hot zones:** Magmar, Growlithe, Vulpix, Ponyta, Magby, Skarmory (nesting)  
**Forest interior:** Oddish, Bellsprout, Tangela, Exeggcute, Weedle, Caterpie, Paras, Rattata, Spearow  
**Water sources:** Poliwag, Psyduck, Goldeen, Lotad  
**Cave system:** Zubat, Geodude, Onix, Sandshrew, Magmar

Local authorities strongly discourage inexperienced trainers from entering due to Skarmory attacks and geothermal hazards.
