# Viridian Hinterlands (Route 1 Off-Route Locations)

Overview
- The countryside between Pallet Town, Route 1, and Viridian sits on the outer skirts of the Indigo mountain front (Victory Road / Mt. Silver massif). Short detours off the marked path quickly enter rough terrain. Rangers warn that going too deep trends toward Victory Road hazard zones.
- Use these locations for side quests, survival beats, or to seed mini‑arcs. Day/night and weather can sharply change difficulty.

Access & Safety
- Licensing: Traveling with 1 Pokemon is a protected right; deeper missions may require licensed escorts or Ranger oversight.
- Signage: Expect posted warnings at mouths of caves, bluffs, and washes. “Deep layer” entries below indicate zones novices should avoid.
- Tone knobs: Day vs night spawns, headbutt trees (HGSS flavor), version‑leaning flora (Oddish/Bellsprout) are world‑building dials, not strict rules.

Story Integration Notes
- Candidate follower mons that fit survival + outsider themes: Nidoran♀/Nidoran♂, Mankey, Rattata, Pidgey, Tangela.
- Avoid recent‑trauma water beats near Pallet; keep quarry sump and marsh footing safe or off‑screen.
- Use Ranger job slips to justify presence without full licensing: escort, survey, nest counts, retrievals.

Version/Source Flavor
- FRLG: Route 1 core spawns (Pidgey/Rattata), Route 22 adds Mankey/Spearow/Nidoran; caves support Zubat/Geodude/Onix flavor.
- HGSS: Headbutt trees enable Exeggcute/Aipom/Pineco; Noctowl and Heracross cameos feel natural.
- LGPE: Oddish/Bellsprout version flavor, visible overworld density for flocks and hive pockets.
