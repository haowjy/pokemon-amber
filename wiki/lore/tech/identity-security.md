# Identity & Security (Amber Continuity)

## IDs and Enforcement
- IDs: Standardizing but uneven; city‑issued papers/cards vary by municipality.
- Minors: Child IDs inconsistently issued and enforced; visual verification common when traveling with adults.
- Checkpoints: Rare in peacetime; event‑driven in cities (tournaments, League gatherings).

## Institutions
- Civil Authorities: Recently unified regional structures still building capacity.
- League: Expanding cross‑region remit post‑unification; sets baseline safety standards for transit.

## Implications for Story
- Explains lax air travel checks in early chapters (Amber traveling without ID under adult supervision).
- Sets expectations for increasing formality by later arcs (registries, licensing, custody systems).
