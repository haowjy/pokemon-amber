# Transportation

## Air
- Cinnabar model: Beachside/field pads (cleared dirt/grass near dunes/boardwalks) with a small terminal. No blimps; mass transit to/from Cinnabar is by boat. Pads serve licensed trainers and Express flights.
- Operators: Pokemon flights (Pidgeot/Fearow/Noctowl) for short/mid hops; hot‑air balloons for scenic loops (not mass transit).
- Protocols: Electric‑type escorts travel with flight teams for approach/en‑route deterrence (not stationed on pads).

## Sea
- Boats/Ferries (Cinnabar corridor): Primary mass transport for tourists and cargo.
- Protocols: Electric‑type escorts posted on deck during transit to deter wild water types

## Rail / Train
- Conventional rail expanding between towns; service quality varies by region. High‑speed links (e.g., magnet train) are future/under development, not present in this arc.
- Pokemon roles: Electric types for signaling/power maintenance; Rock/Steel for track/tunnel work.

## Subway / Underground
- Present in larger cities; safety and maintenance mirror surface rail. Pokemon involvement as above; League/local rules govern platform behavior.

## Pokemon integration (quick reference)
- Air: Operator‑carried Electric escorts on approach/en route; patrol riders common around fields.
- Sea: Electric escorts on ferries/boats during crossings.
- Rail/Subway: Electric for systems; Rock/Steel for maintenance as needed.
