# Technology Overview (Amber Continuity)

## Snapshot
- Era analogue: Late 1980s edging into early 1990s during this arc; expands toward mid‑1990s by the time MC begins a journey.
- Governments: Recently stabilized federations; bureaucracy uneven across regions.
- Infrastructure: Patchwork; cities are modernizing, inter‑city links are developing, cross‑region links are weak.

## Domains
- Air Travel: Mixed operators (Pokémon flights, hot‑air balloons), beach airfields, lax security.
  - See: [Air Travel](./air-travel.md)
- Communications & Media: Patchy local broadcast; limited cross‑region trunk lines; early satellite adoption.
  - See: [Communications](./communications.md)
- Identity & Security: Inconsistent IDs, visual verification, minimal child ID enforcement; League influence rising.
  - See: [Identity & Security](./identity-security.md)

## Trajectory
- Short term: Standardization attempts (IDs, manifests, licensing) roll out unevenly; League authority extends via Indigo joint administration.
- Medium term: Satellite relays, inter‑region roads, and League registries tighten systems.
