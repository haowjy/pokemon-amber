# Technology Overview (Amber Continuity)

## Snapshot
- Era analogue: Late 1980s edging into early 1990s during this arc; expands toward mid‑1990s by the time MC begins a journey.
- Governments: Recently stabilized federations; bureaucracy uneven across regions.
- Infrastructure: Patchwork; cities are modernizing, inter‑city links are developing, cross‑region links are weak.

## Domains
- Transportation: Air/Sea/Rail/Subway snapshot. Cinnabar uses beachside/field pads (no blimps); mass transit to/from Cinnabar is by boat. Lax security observed; Express wing formations are premium. Pricing varies by region; on Cinnabar corridor: boats cheapest, Pokemon flights expensive, Express most expensive.

- Communications & Media: Patchy local broadcast; limited cross‑region trunk lines; early satellite adoption.
  - See: [Communications](./communications.md)
- Identity & Security: Inconsistent IDs, visual verification, minimal child ID enforcement; League influence rising.

## Trajectory
- Short term: Tourist growth at hubs like Cinnabar drives ad‑hoc airfields (blimp masts + Pokemon pads); standardization (IDs, manifests, licensing) rolls out unevenly; League authority extends via Indigo joint administration.
- Medium term: Satellite relays, inter‑region roads, and League registries tighten systems; formal airports emerge near cities as demand matures.
