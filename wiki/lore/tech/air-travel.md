# Air Travel (Amber Continuity)

## Airfields and Operators
- Beach Airfields: Open‑air strips near beaches with minimal facilities (wind socks, chalked lanes, manifest boards).
- Operators:
  - Pokémon Flights (Pidgeot, Fearow, Noctowl): Cheaper, faster on short/mid hops; licensed riders.
  - Hot‑Air Balloons: Pricier scenic routes; slower, tourist‑oriented.
- Manifests: Often handwritten; whistle codes coordinate departures.

## Ticketing and Security
- Kiosks: Cash/credit chit; handwritten/stamped receipts.
- Security: Lax visual checks; minors with adults generally waved through; ID for kids inconsistently enforced.
- Pricing: Pokémon flights cheaper than balloons (supply, speed, capacity).

## Safety and Regulation
- Licensing: Exists but spotty enforcement.
- Weather Protocols: Coastal advisories; balloons most affected.
- Pokémon Welfare: Basic posted checklists; compliance culture emerging.
