# Communications (Amber Continuity)

## Broadcast and Networks
- Local Broadcast: City/municipal towers cover population centers.
- Cross‑Region TV: Limited; no robust underground trunk lines; dependence on local relays.
- Satellite: Early adoption during this arc; becomes common by MC’s later journey era.

## Messaging and Data
- Postal + Courier Pokémon: Reliable within regions; cross‑region routes sparse.
- League Relays: Preferential access for League operations; not widely available to civilians yet.

## Trajectory
- 1980s analogue: Patchwork; regional isolation common.
- 1990s analogue: Satellite relays and standardized infrastructure improve coverage and latency.
