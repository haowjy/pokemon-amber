# Trainer Licensing & Carry Limits

Licenses regulate who may legally handle, register, and carry multiple Pokemon. They exist for public safety and to manage the risks of trainer–Pokemon energy bonds. Licenses are distinct from badges: licenses enable legal handling and quest contracting, while badges reflect gym trust and influence Conference qualification.

## Historical Context: Right to Pokemon Companion

The modern licensing system evolved from an ancient cultural and legal principle: **the right to a Pokemon companion**.

### Original Intent
- Foundational to Pokemon-human society for centuries
- Every person had the right to bond with Pokemon without restriction
- No paperwork, no limitations, no government oversight
- Seen as basic as rights to property or self-defense

### Modern Interpretation
Over time, safety concerns, welfare issues, and post-war security needs led to increasing restrictions:
- **1 Pokemon** remains a protected right (no license required)
- **2-6 Pokemon** now requires government-issued Trainer License
- Shift from unlimited right → regulated privilege for multiple Pokemon

### Political Debate
The restriction remains controversial:
- **Traditionalists:** Argue 1 Pokemon is too restrictive; should allow 3-4 before requiring license
- **Progressives:** Argue even 1 Pokemon should require licensing for safety and welfare
- **Current compromise:** 1 Pokemon protected as cultural/legal right, 2+ regulated

This debate continues in regional legislatures, with proposals ranging from further restrictions to deregulation.

## Why Licenses Exist

- **Safety:** Active bonds create a physiological energy link; mass fainting events can cause backlash onto the trainer
- **Accountability:** Registration ties Pokemon custody to a responsible adult/guardian or licensed trainer
- **Welfare:** Multiple Pokemon require proper care, training, and resources; licensing ensures minimum standards
- **Ecosystem protection:** Improper releases and abandonment damage habitats; licensing creates accountability
- **Post-war security:** Tracking trainers with multiple Pokemon helps prevent organized threats

## Carry Limit (Legal and Physiological)

- Standard carry limit is 6 active, bonded Pokemon
- Exceeding 6 significantly increases risk during multi‑Pokemon fainting; trainers may collapse from cumulative backlash
- The 6‑limit is both a legal regulation and a widely accepted safety threshold established by medical and Ranger data
- Stored (stabled) Pokemon are not actively bonded and do not count against the carry limit

### Over‑Carry (Advanced Exceptions)
- Facility‑supervised drills (gyms, academies) may approve temporary over‑carry for training with medical monitoring
- Rangers may authorize temporary field waivers during crises (documented, time‑boxed)
- Ace‑level trainers with demonstrated aura control may manage synchronized recoveries more safely, but over‑carry remains exceptional

## License Tiers

### No License Required (1 Pokemon)

**What you can do:**
- Own and bond with a single Pokemon
- Travel freely with your companion
- Basic protection and utility
- This is a constitutional/cultural right

**What you cannot do:**
- Catch or register additional Pokemon
- Access official quest boards (most require Trainer License)
- Participate in Conference tournaments
- Use Pokemon Center storage systems (only needed for multiple Pokemon)

**Who has just 1 Pokemon:**
- Regular citizens with family/companion Pokemon
- Children with starter Pokemon waiting to pass Trainer License exam
- People who want companionship without pursuing trainer career
- Individuals fleeing circumstances (legal to have 1 Pokemon without paperwork)

### Trainer License (2-6 Pokemon)

**Standard examination (all ages):**

The Trainer License exam is a **single standard test** administered to all applicants regardless of age. Most applicants are 13-15 years old, but the exam does not have age-based tiers.

**Requirements:**
1. **Written component:**
   - Pokemon type matchups and battle fundamentals
   - Care, welfare, and first aid
   - Safety protocols and regulations
   - Route navigation and survival basics

2. **Knowledge assessment:**
   - Understanding of Pokemon behavior
   - Strategic thinking demonstration
   - Ethical treatment principles
   - Legal responsibilities

3. **Practical battle component:**
   - Applicant's Pokemon must demonstrate competency
   - Battle against certified examiner
   - Shows control, training quality, and trainer-Pokemon bond

**Why most 10-year-olds don't pass:**
- Haven't studied enough (knowledge gaps in written exam)
- Pokemon not trained adequately (only had starter a short time)
- Can't strategize effectively yet (immature tactical thinking)
- Most wait until age 13-15 to attempt exam

**Exceptions (age 10-12 passers):**
- Exceptionally intelligent children
- Those with strong, well-trained starter Pokemon
- War orphans forced into early independence
- Rare cases with meta knowledge or unusual circumstances

**What it unlocks:**
- Carry up to 6 active Pokemon
- Catch and register additional Pokemon
- Access to official quest boards
- Participate in gym challenges and Conference qualification
- Pokemon Center storage/stabling system
- Legal recognition as professional Trainer

**Notes:**
- Exam administered at Pokemon Centers and designated testing facilities
- Small fee (₽10-20, nominal)
- **Pokeballs NOT included** - trainers must purchase separately (₽200 each, see [Pokeball Economics](../economics/pokeball-pricing.md))
- Failed exams can be retaken after 30-day waiting period

### Gym Trainer License
   - Issued via: Sponsoring gym
   - Carry Limit: 6 (facility support may allow supervised over‑carry for drills)
   - Requirements: Employment + internal training standards
   - Notes: Grants access to restricted facility areas and instructional roles

### Ranger License
   - Issued via: Ranger Union
   - Carry Limit: 6 (special field waivers for crisis deployments)
   - Requirements: Ranger academy, field tests, background checks
   - Notes: Government authority for route maintenance and emergency response

### Ace Trainer Recognition (Status)
   - Defined as: Holds ≥1 Elite Badge
   - Carry Limit: 6 (some leaders train to safely manage synchronized recoveries)
   - Notes: Frequently contracted by government; eligible for gym leader consideration

## Registration and Stabling

- **Registration:** Captured Pokemon must be registered to a licensed custodian; minors require guardian linkage
- **Stabling:** Excess Pokemon must be stabled with an approved sponsor (gym, ranch, professor, or licensed facility)
- **Transfers:** Ownership transfers require mutual consent and registry update at a Pokemon Center

## Quests and Legal Work

- **Legal requirement for contracting:** Valid Trainer License
- Posters may request specific badges or experience, but badges are not a universal legal gate
- Government/Ranger contracts often prefer Elite Badge (Ace) holders for high‑risk assignments

## Cultural Context: Journey as "College"

In modern Pokemon society, trainer journeys have become culturally expected—similar to college education in terms of social importance and economic impact:

### Social Expectations
- Most children are expected to attempt Trainer License exam between ages 13-15
- Many receive starter Pokemon at age 10 but wait years to take exam
- Not attempting a journey carries social stigma and limits job prospects
- Failing exam or returning early from journey is disappointing but common and accepted
- Never trying is considered worse than trying and failing

### Economic Reality
- **Middle-class families:** Save for years to fund their children's journeys (supplies, Pokemon, study materials, exam fees, budget for 6-12 months)
- **Wealthy families:** Fully fund journeys with best equipment, bred Pokemon, private tutors for exam prep
- **Poor families:** Rely on sponsorships or their children working during journeys; may take exam multiple times

### Sponsorship Systems
- **Professor sponsorships:** Oak and other professors give starter Pokemon to promising children
- **Gym scholarships:** Talented trainers may receive support from gyms (including exam prep)
- **Ranger programs:** Government-funded training for those interested in public service
- **Family Pokemon:** Some families breed and raise Pokemon for their children

### Typical Outcomes
Most trainers achieve modest results:
- **2-3 badges:** Respectable, demonstrates work ethic, employable in Pokemon-related fields
- **4-6 badges:** Very successful, qualifies for management and specialist positions
- **7-8 badges:** Elite achievement, leadership positions, celebrity status
- **Conference qualification:** Top 1%, considered exceptional achievement

### Journey Economics
- Average journey length: 6-18 months after obtaining license
- Most trainers return home due to: running out of money, homesickness, injury, or plateau in progress
- Successful trainers often transition to: gym employment, breeding operations, Pokemon Centers, regional government, or Ranger Union

## Canon Divergence

- Introduces explicit licensing with physiological justification for the six‑Pokemon limit
- Separates licensing (legal) from badges (trust/qualification)
- Adds "journey as college" cultural framework explaining social expectations
- Creates "right to 1 Pokemon" as historical/cultural foundation
- Single standard exam for all ages (no age-specific tiers)
- Political debate over restriction levels reflects modern governance
