# Trainer Licensing & Carry Limits

Licenses regulate who may legally handle, register, and carry Pokemon. They exist for public safety and to manage the risks of trainer–Pokemon energy bonds. Licenses are distinct from badges: licenses enable legal handling and quest contracting, while badges reflect gym trust and influence League qualification.

## Why Licenses Exist

- Safety: Active bonds create a physiological energy link; mass fainting events can cause backlash onto the trainer
- Accountability: Registration ties Pokemon custody to a responsible adult/guardian or licensed trainer
- Welfare: Stored Pokemon require approved stabling or sponsorship for proper care

## Carry Limit (Legal and Physiological)

- Standard carry limit is 6 active, bonded Pokemon
- Exceeding 6 significantly increases risk during multi‑Pokemon fainting; trainers may collapse from cumulative backlash
- The 6‑limit is both a legal regulation and a widely accepted safety threshold established by medical and Ranger data
- Stored (stabled) Pokemon are not actively bonded and do not count against the carry limit

### Over‑Carry (Advanced Exceptions)
- Facility‑supervised drills (gyms, academies) may approve temporary over‑carry for training with medical monitoring
- Rangers may authorize temporary field waivers during crises (documented, time‑boxed)
- Ace‑level trainers with demonstrated aura control may manage synchronized recoveries more safely, but over‑carry remains exceptional

## License Tiers

1. Learner’s Permit (Junior)
   - Typical Age: 10+
   - Carry Limit: 1 Pokemon
   - Requirements: Guardian consent, basic written + practical safety test
   - Notes: Intended for supervised learning and early companionship

2. Standard Trainer License
   - Typical Age: 13+
   - Carry Limit: 6 Pokemon
   - Requirements: Practical competency exam, safety and care certification
   - Notes: Enables independent travel and standard quest contracting

3. Gym Trainer License
   - Issued via: Sponsoring gym
   - Carry Limit: 6 (facility support may allow supervised over‑carry for drills)
   - Requirements: Employment + internal training standards
   - Notes: Grants access to restricted facility areas and instructional roles

4. Ranger License
   - Issued via: Ranger Union
   - Carry Limit: 6 (special field waivers for crisis deployments)
   - Requirements: Ranger academy, field tests, background checks
   - Notes: Government authority for route maintenance and emergency response

5. Ace Trainer Recognition (Status)
   - Defined as: Holds ≥1 Elite Badge
   - Carry Limit: 6 (some leaders train to safely manage synchronized recoveries)
   - Notes: Frequently contracted by government; eligible for gym leader consideration

## Registration and Stabling

- Registration: Captured Pokemon must be registered to a licensed custodian; minors require guardian linkage
- Stabling: Excess Pokemon must be stabled with an approved sponsor (gym, ranch, professor, or licensed facility)
- Transfers: Ownership transfers require mutual consent and registry update at a Pokemon Center

## Quests and Legal Work

- Legal requirement for contracting: Valid trainer license
- Posters may request specific badges or experience, but badges are not a universal legal gate
- Government/Ranger contracts often prefer Elite Badge (Ace) holders for high‑risk assignments

## Canon Divergence

- Introduces explicit licensing with physiological justification for the six‑Pokemon limit
- Separates licensing (legal) from badges (trust/qualification)
