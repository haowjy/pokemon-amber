# Trainer Licensing & Carry Limits

Trainer registration and Pokemon carry limits are regulated through a simple three-tier system: 1 Pokemon is a constitutional right, Trainer ID is easy registration, and gym badges unlock multi-Pokemon carry limits. This decentralized system reflects gym councils' authority as regional government.

## Historical Context: Right to Pokemon Companion

The modern licensing system evolved from an ancient cultural and legal principle: **the right to a Pokemon companion**.

### Original Intent
- Foundational to Pokemon-human society for centuries
- Every person had the right to bond with Pokemon without restriction
- No paperwork, no limitations, no government oversight
- Seen as basic as rights to property or self-defense

### Modern Interpretation
Over time, safety concerns, welfare issues, and post-war security needs led to increasing restrictions:
- **1 Pokemon** remains a protected right (no paperwork required)
- **Trainer ID** now required for official trainer activities (easy registration)
- **2-6 Pokemon** requires gym badge (gym leader vouches for competency)
- Shift from unlimited right → regulated privilege for multiple Pokemon

### Political Debate
The restriction remains controversial:
- **Traditionalists:** Argue 1 Pokemon is too restrictive; should allow 3-4 before requiring license
- **Progressives:** Argue even 1 Pokemon should require licensing for safety and welfare
- **Current compromise:** 1 Pokemon protected as cultural/legal right, 2+ regulated

This debate continues in regional legislatures, with proposals ranging from further restrictions to deregulation.

## Why Licenses Exist

- **Safety:** Active bonds create a physiological energy link; mass fainting events can cause backlash onto the trainer
- **Accountability:** Registration ties Pokemon custody to a responsible adult/guardian or licensed trainer
- **Welfare:** Multiple Pokemon require proper care, training, and resources; licensing ensures minimum standards
- **Ecosystem protection:** Improper releases and abandonment damage habitats; licensing creates accountability
- **Post-war security:** Tracking trainers with multiple Pokemon helps prevent organized threats

## How the System Works

**Three Tiers:**
1. **1 Pokemon** - Constitutional right, no paperwork required
2. **Trainer ID** - Simple registration (easy to obtain)
3. **First Gym Badge** - Unlocks 2-6 Pokemon carry limit

## Carry Limit (Legal and Physiological)

- Standard carry limit is 6 active, bonded Pokemon
- Exceeding 6 significantly increases risk during multi‑Pokemon fainting; trainers may collapse from cumulative backlash
- The 6‑limit is both a legal regulation and a widely accepted safety threshold established by medical and Ranger data
- Stored (stabled) Pokemon are not actively bonded and do not count against the carry limit
- **Carry limit unlocked by gym badges**, not by exam difficulty

### Over‑Carry (Advanced Exceptions)
- Facility‑supervised drills (gyms, academies) may approve temporary over‑carry for training with medical monitoring
- Rangers may authorize temporary field waivers during crises (documented, time‑boxed)
- Ace‑level trainers with demonstrated aura control may manage synchronized recoveries more safely, but over‑carry remains exceptional

## License Tiers

### No License Required (1 Pokemon)

**What you can do:**
- Own and bond with a single Pokemon
- Travel freely with your companion
- Basic protection and utility
- This is a constitutional/cultural right

**What you cannot do:**
- Catch or register additional Pokemon (need gym badge for multi-Pokemon)
- Access official quest boards (requires Trainer ID)
- Challenge gyms officially (requires Trainer ID)
- Use Pokemon Center storage systems (only needed for multiple Pokemon)

**Who has just 1 Pokemon:**
- Regular citizens with family/companion Pokemon
- Children with starter Pokemon not yet registered as trainers
- People who want companionship without pursuing trainer career
- Individuals fleeing circumstances (legal to have 1 Pokemon without paperwork)

### Trainer ID Registration (Easy to Obtain)

**Purpose:**
- Legal recognition as trainer
- Access to quest boards
- Pokemon Center services (formal registration)
- Required to challenge gyms officially

**Analogy: Driver's License**
- The 1 Pokemon limit is like a **learner's permit** (constitutional right, no test)
- Trainer ID is like a **driver's license** (easy test showing basic competency)
- First gym badge is like **advanced certification** (proves real skill)

**Requirements:**
- **Must possess at least 1 Pokemon** (to register as trainer)
- Proof of identity (any documentation, loosely enforced in decentralized system)
- Literacy demonstration (read basic signs, fill out forms)
- **Pass basic competency test** administered by any existing trainer at Pokemon Center

**The Test:**
- Takes 15-30 minutes
- Administered by any existing trainer volunteering at Pokemon Center (often gym trainers, Rangers, or experienced locals)
- **Demonstrates your Pokemon listens to you** - the mark of an actual trainer
- Basic commands: sit, stay, come, use a move on command, stop on command
- Safety knowledge: "What do you do if Pokemon faints?" "How to avoid wild Pokemon attacks?"
- **Pretty easy to pass** if you have basic bond with your Pokemon
- Failed test can be retried after more training

**Process:**
- Walk into any Pokemon Center
- Fill out registration form (₽5-10 fee)
- Wait for available trainer to administer test
- Demonstrate Pokemon obedience and answer safety questions
- Receive Trainer ID card if passed
- **Almost everyone who tries gets one** (but must demonstrate competency)

**No Age Restriction:**
- Anyone can get Trainer ID at any age
- Guardian presence encouraged for young children (10 and under) but not legally required
- Most people don't bother getting one until they're ready for their journey (like how people don't get driver's license until they need it)

**What Trainer ID Unlocks:**
- Legal trainer status
- Quest board access (though most quests require team, not solo Pokemon)
- Pokemon Center healing (already available, but formally registered)
- Ability to challenge gyms officially
- **Does NOT unlock multi-Pokemon carry** - still limited to 1 Pokemon until badge

### First Gym Badge Unlocks Multi-Pokemon Carry (2-6 Pokemon)

**How It Works:**
- Trainer with ID challenges gym
- Gym evaluates trainer through battle (not necessarily gym leader - often gym trainers for first badge)
- **First badge earned = unlocks 2-6 Pokemon carry limit**
- Badge represents gym leader vouching for trainer's competency
- Any gym's badge works - doesn't matter which one

**Why Badges, Not Exams:**
- Gyms ARE the regional authority (decentralized government)
- Gym leaders best positioned to evaluate trainer competency
- Personal judgment more reliable than standardized test in decentralized system
- Prevents mass-catching without proven skill (lesson from Mt. Silver)
- Forces trainers to engage with gym system
- Regional variation (each gym has own standards)

**Practical Effect:**
- Can obtain Trainer ID easily at age 10 (or any age)
- But can't build team until earning first badge
- First gym battle is CRITICAL (unlocks team building)
- Most trainers challenge Pewter, Cerulean, or local gym first (easier gyms for beginners)
- Economic factor: Can't afford 6 Pokeballs immediately anyway (₽1,200+ total)

**What Multi-Pokemon Carry Enables:**
- Carry up to 6 active Pokemon (once you can afford to catch them)
- Catch and register additional Pokemon
- Pokemon Center storage/stabling system
- Participate in Conference qualification (requires 8 badges, separate requirement)
- Access to higher-tier quests (many require team, not solo Pokemon)
- Legal recognition as professional multi-Pokemon Trainer

**Notes:**
- **Pokeballs NOT included** - trainers must purchase separately (₽200 each, see [Pokeball Economics](../economics/pokeball-pricing.md))
- Badge standards vary by gym (Pewter easier than Saffron for first-timers)
- Failed gym challenges can be retried after training more
- Some gyms offer training programs before official challenge

### Gym Trainer License
   - Issued via: Sponsoring gym
   - Carry Limit: 6 (facility support may allow supervised over‑carry for drills)
   - Requirements: Employment + internal training standards
   - Notes: Grants access to restricted facility areas and instructional roles

### Ranger License
   - Issued via: Ranger Union
   - Carry Limit: 6 (special field waivers for crisis deployments)
   - Requirements: Ranger academy, field tests, background checks
   - Notes: Government authority for route maintenance and emergency response

### Ace Trainer Recognition (Status)
   - Defined as: Holds ≥1 Elite Badge
   - Carry Limit: 6 (some leaders train to safely manage synchronized recoveries)
   - Notes: Frequently contracted by government; eligible for gym leader consideration

## Registration and Stabling

- **Registration:** Captured Pokemon must be registered to a licensed custodian; minors require guardian linkage
- **Stabling:** Excess Pokemon must be stabled with an approved sponsor (gym, ranch, professor, or licensed facility)
- **Transfers:** Ownership transfers require mutual consent and registry update at a Pokemon Center

## Quests and Legal Work

- **Legal requirement for contracting:** Valid Trainer ID
- Most quests require team (multi-Pokemon), so effectively need gym badge
- Posters may request specific badges or experience for higher-tier work
- Government/Ranger contracts often prefer Ace Badge holders for high‑risk assignments

## Cultural Context: Journey as "College"

In modern Pokemon society, trainer journeys have become culturally expected—similar to college education in terms of social importance and economic impact:

### Social Expectations
- Most children are expected to obtain Trainer ID and attempt first gym badge between ages 13-15
- Many receive starter Pokemon at age 10 but wait years to challenge gym
- Not attempting a journey carries social stigma and limits job prospects
- Failing gym challenge or returning early from journey is disappointing but common and accepted
- Never trying is considered worse than trying and failing

### Economic Reality
- **Middle-class families:** Save for years to fund their children's journeys (supplies, Pokeballs, camping gear, budget for 6-12 months)
- **Wealthy families:** Fully fund journeys with best equipment, bred Pokemon, private training for gym challenges
- **Poor families:** Rely on sponsorships or their children working during journeys; may attempt first gym challenge multiple times

### Sponsorship Systems
- **Professor sponsorships:** Oak and other professors give starter Pokemon to promising children
- **Gym scholarships:** Talented trainers may receive support from gyms (including training before challenge)
- **Ranger programs:** Government-funded training for those interested in public service
- **Family Pokemon:** Some families breed and raise Pokemon for their children (clan tradition)

### Typical Outcomes
Most trainers achieve modest results:
- **2-3 badges:** Respectable, demonstrates work ethic, employable in Pokemon-related fields
- **4-6 badges:** Very successful, qualifies for management and specialist positions
- **7-8 badges:** Elite achievement, leadership positions, celebrity status
- **Conference qualification:** Top 1%, considered exceptional achievement

### Journey Economics
- Average journey length: 6-18 months after obtaining first badge
- Most trainers return home due to: running out of money, homesickness, injury, or plateau in progress
- Successful trainers often transition to: gym employment, breeding operations, Pokemon Centers, regional government, or Ranger Union
- Post-war context: Journey culture STRONG (not declining) as it fills gaps in overwhelmed social services

## Canon Divergence

- Introduces explicit licensing with physiological justification for the six‑Pokemon limit
- **Badges unlock carry limit** instead of exam-based licensing (gyms as gatekeepers)
- Trainer ID is easy registration (minimal barriers)
- Separates registration (legal status) from badges (competency/carry limit)
- Adds "journey as college" cultural framework explaining social expectations
- Creates "right to 1 Pokemon" as historical/cultural foundation
- Gym leaders serve as gatekeepers for multi-Pokemon training (decentralized authority)
- Political debate over restriction levels reflects modern governance
- Fits decentralized confederation structure (gyms have authority, not central bureaucracy)
- Post-war context: Journey culture encouraged to fill social service gaps
