# Quest System & Job Boards

The **Quest System** is a coordinated network of freelance Pokemon training work, posted on job boards at Pokemon Centers throughout Kanto-Johto. It provides economic opportunities for licensed trainers while supplementing the work of professional [Rangers](../organizations/ranger-union.md).

## Overview

Pokemon Center job boards display paid work opportunities requiring Pokemon training skills. Quests range from simple berry collection to dangerous rescue operations, with difficulty ratings and pay scaling accordingly. The system is coordinated through Pokemon Centers but funded by various sources: government [Rangers](../organizations/ranger-union.md), [gyms](./gym-system.md), private businesses, and individual citizens.

**First Documented Appearance:** [Chapter 7](../../../story/chapter7/chapter7.md) - Amber discovers the job board at Celadon Pokemon Center.

## Quest Categories

Quests are organized by type, marked with colored paper and bracketed labels:

### [Item] Quests (White Paper)
Collection and retrieval of materials.

**Examples:**
- "[Item] Berry Collection - Celadon Hills (Moderate) ₽15" ([Chapter 7](../../../story/chapter7/chapter7.md))
- "[Item] Wild Pokemon Census - Viridian Forest (Moderate) ₽30"
- "[Item] Fire Stone Recovery - Flame Forest Outskirts (Dangerous) ₽80"

**Typical Difficulty:** Simple to Moderate, peaceful Pokemon for companionship and protection

### [Defeat] Quests (Orange Paper)
Removal of problem Pokemon from settled areas or routes.

**Examples:**
- "[Defeat] Rogue Eevee and Eeveelutions Route 7 - Exercise Caution (Moderate) ₽80" ([Chapter 7](../../../story/chapter7/chapter7.md))
- "[Defeat] Grimer Colony - Sewer System (Moderate) ₽60"
- "[Defeat] Aggressive Spearow Near Farms (Simple) ₽30"

**Typical Difficulty:** Moderate to Dangerous, strong battle-capable team

**Note:** "Defeat" typically means drive away, capture and relocate, or calm down - not kill. Lethal force is rarely authorized and must be explicitly stated in quest parameters.

### [Rescue] Quests (Yellow Paper)
Retrieval of lost trainers, civilians, or fainted Pokemon.

**Examples:**
- "Why were there so many about retrieving 'fainted' Pokemon left in forests?" ([Chapter 7](../../../story/chapter7/chapter7.md) - Amber's observation)
- "[Rescue] Lost Trainer - Mt. Moon Sector 3 (Dangerous) ₽120"
- "[Rescue] Fainted Pokemon Retrieval - Route 9 (Moderate) ₽50"

**Typical Difficulty:** Moderate to Dangerous, tracking Pokemon, rescue equipment

**Context - Fainted Pokemon:** When Pokemon faint, they [cannot be recalled to their Pokeballs](../mechanics/pokemon-fainting.md). Trainers sometimes panic and flee, or become injured themselves, leaving their Pokemon behind. These rescues are time-sensitive as fainted Pokemon are vulnerable to predators and exposure.

### [WANTED] Quests (Red Paper)
High-priority threats requiring immediate attention, often with substantial bounties.

**Examples:**
- "[WANTED] Thief that stole an Oddish from Celadon Gym Greenhouse (Simple) ₽50" ([Chapter 7](../../../story/chapter7/chapter7.md))
- "[WANTED] Mass Sleep Incident - Saffron City Hypno (Extreme) ₽20,000" ([Chapter 7](../../../story/chapter7/chapter7.md))

**Typical Difficulty:** Varies by threat (Simple to Extreme), investigation skills often needed

**High Bounties:** Major public safety threats can offer enormous rewards. The Hypno incident's ₽20,000 bounty reflects its severity - a mass casualty incident in a major city ([Chapter 7](../../../story/chapter7/chapter7.md)).

### [Escort] Quests (Blue Paper)
Protection services for people or cargo traveling through dangerous areas.

**Examples:**
- "[Escort] Executive Transport - Silph Co to Pokemon Center (Dangerous) ₽80"
- "[Escort] Cargo Delivery - Route 12 (Moderate) ₽60"

**Typical Difficulty:** Moderate to Dangerous, reliable defensive Pokemon

### [Investigation] Quests (Green Paper)
Information gathering, tracking, and detective work.

**Examples:**
- "[Investigation] Suspicious Activity - Route 8 (Moderate) ₽50"
- "[Investigation] Missing Pokemon Pattern Analysis (Dangerous) ₽100"

**Typical Difficulty:** Moderate to Dangerous, observation skills, discretion

## Quest Requirements

### License Mandatory

Every quest requires a valid [trainer license](./trainer-licensing.md). Trainers present their license at reception; Pokemon Centers verify credentials before assignment.

**How It Works:**
- License holder selects a quest and checks in at reception
- Posters may specify preferred badges (reputation/insurance) or other prerequisites
- Multi‑area quests list logistics and any special requirements

**Why This Requirement:**
- Legal liability and insurance (contracts require a licensed counterparty)
- Safety standards (minimum demonstrated competence via licensing)
- Accountability (verifiable identity and registry tie‑ins)

### Class Grades (Public Boards)

Quests list public class grades to help trainers self‑assess. Typical payout and expected team capability bands:

**Class Scale (capability ~ bands; payouts illustrative):**
- **Class E** – ~10–25 capability; ₽50–200
- **Class D** – ~20–35; ₽200–600
- **Class C** – ~30–45; ₽600–1,500
- **Class B** – ~45–60; ₽1,500–4,000
- **Class A** – ~60–70+; ₽4,000–20,000+
- **Class S** – Off‑board, invitation‑only via Rangers/government (e.g., ₽20,000 Hypno incident)

**Not Enforced:**
- Grades are guidance, not requirements
- Posters may include "Recommended: Experienced trainers"
- Your choice if you bite off more than you can chew

**Natural Selection:**
- Take quest too hard → likely fail or get hurt
- Failure affects reputation
- Too many failures → harder to get future assignments
- Death in wilderness → you were warned

### Additional Requirements

Some quests specify:
- Type specialists ("Grass-type experience preferred")
- Team size ("Minimum 4 Pokemon")
- Special equipment ("Climbing gear required")
- Specific badges preferred ("Boulder Badge preferred" for cave work)
- Experience level ("Experienced trainers only - 3+ badges")

### Elite Quests

The highest difficulty quests (for regional threats, legendary encounters) are **not posted on public boards**. These are assigned directly through government, [Ranger](../organizations/ranger-union.md), or [Ace Trainer](../organizations/ace-trainers.md) channels for classified missions.

## Payment & Compensation

### Payment Structure

- **Fixed bounty:** Most quests offer set payment upon completion
- **Proof required:** Photos, witness statements, Ranger verification
- **Paid through Pokemon Center:** Quest completion verified, payment issued
- **No completion, no pay:** Failed quests don't earn compensation (though partial credit sometimes given)

### Payment Ranges by Class

Standardized target ranges (actual postings vary by region, sponsor, urgency):

- **E:** ₽50–200 (safe work, errands, basic collection)
- **D:** ₽200–600 (moderate danger, routine investigations/pest control)
- **C:** ₽600–1,500 (significant risk, complex rescues/operations)
- **B:** ₽1,500–4,000 (high‑risk missions, specialist skills)
- **A:** ₽4,000–20,000+ (major threats, critical emergencies)

**Exceptional Bounties:** S‑Class incidents can vastly exceed normal ranges (e.g., Saffron Hypno ₽20,000 per [Chapter 7](../../../story/chapter7/chapter7.md)).

### Additional Compensation

- **Hazard pay:** Dangerous conditions add bonuses
- **Urgency bonuses:** Time-critical quests pay premium
- **Item rights:** Some quests let you keep found items (Fire Stones, etc.)
- **Experience:** Build reputation for harder quests
- **Repeat business:** Quest posters may prefer trainers they've worked with

### Medical, Insurance, and Equipment
- Pokemon Center network offers standardized treatment rates for licensed trainers; quest payouts assume Center‑rate medical billing
- Many institutional quests include a small insurance add‑on (2–8%) covering basic trainer medical care and emergency transport
- Government/Ranger quests typically include equipment stipends or reimbursement for mission‑critical gear
- Private posters may offer hazard insurance riders for A/B‑class work; advisable for independent trainers

## Quest Sources

### Ranger Requests

[Rangers](../organizations/ranger-union.md) are the largest quest posters, outsourcing work they can't handle due to limited personnel.

**Common Ranger Quests:**
- Route maintenance (clearing aggressive Pokemon from main paths)
- Census and monitoring (data collection)
- Supplementary rescue operations
- Disaster response support
- Off-route problem Pokemon

**Example:** "[Ranger Request] Route 7 Spearow Flock Management (Moderate) ₽50 - Contact Ranger Station 7"

**Why Rangers Post Quests:**
- Limited staff (can't be everywhere)
- Focus on maintaining main routes (their primary mission)
- Multiple simultaneous issues (priority system)
- Surge capacity needs (busy seasons, emergencies)
- Specialized skills (Rangers might lack Grass-type expertise)

### Gym Requests

[Gyms](./gym-system.md) post quests related to their facilities and local ecology.

**Common Gym Quests:**
- Greenhouse maintenance
- Escaped or stolen Pokemon recovery
- Training field upkeep
- Educational programs support
- Local area patrol

**Example:** "[WANTED] Thief that stole an Oddish from Celadon Gym Greenhouse (Simple) ₽50" ([Chapter 7](../../../story/chapter7/chapter7.md))

### Private Businesses

Corporations and businesses hire trainers for protection and transport.

**Common Business Quests:**
- Cargo escort
- VIP transport
- Facility security
- Pest control

**Example:** Silph Co regularly posts high-paying escort quests for executive transport.

### Private Citizens

Individuals can post personal requests, usually at lower budgets.

**Common Private Quests:**
- Lost Pokemon recovery
- Property protection
- Small-scale pest removal
- Personal escort

**Payment:** Usually lower than institutional quests but accessible to trainers with just 1-2 badges.

### Government/Emergency

Regional government posts emergency response and critical infrastructure quests.

**Common Government Quests:**
- Disaster response (fires, floods, earthquakes)
- Public safety threats
- Critical infrastructure protection
- Emergency evacuations

**Payment:** Often includes hazard pay and bonuses, plus potential awards for exceptional service.

## Quest Acceptance Process

1. **Browse Job Board** at Pokemon Center
2. **Select Quest** and review prerequisites
3. **Present License** at Pokemon Center reception (badges if requested)
4. **Quest Assigned** - receive details, contact information, supplies if provided
5. **Complete Objective** - follow quest parameters
6. **Report Completion** - return to Pokemon Center with proof
7. **Verification** - Rangers or quest poster confirm completion
8. **Payment Issued** - receive compensation through Pokemon Center

**Time Limits:** Most quests have completion windows. Failure to complete may result in cancellation and reposting.

**Cancellation:** Trainers can decline or cancel accepted quests, but excessive cancellations may hurt reputation.

## Regional Variations

While the quest system is standardized, regional differences exist:

### Urban Centers (Saffron, Celadon)
- More investigation and escort quests
- Urban Pokemon management (Grimer, Rattata)
- Higher average pay (cost of living)
- More private business quests

### Wilderness Hubs (Pewter, Viridian)
- Route maintenance dominant
- Cave/mountain specialist quests
- Lower pay but higher volume
- More Ranger requests

### Coastal Areas (Vermillion, Cerulean)
- Aquatic Pokemon quests
- Port security
- Water route management
- Fishing industry support

### Dangerous Zones (Cinnabar, Mt. Silver outskirts)
- Very high-paying quests
- Fewer trainers qualified (hard badges required)
- Often multi-badge requirements
- Elite trainers preferred

## Quest System Benefits

### For Trainers
- Flexible income (take quests on your schedule)
- Skill development (practical experience)
- Reputation building (qualify for harder quests)
- Adventure opportunities (explore new areas)
- Supplement competitive training (earn money between tournaments)
- Collect badges for more work areas

### For Society
- Extends Ranger capacity (freelance workforce)
- Economic opportunity (jobs for badged trainers)
- Rapid response (many trainers available)
- Specialization (find trainers with specific skills)
- Lower government costs (pay per task, not salaries)

### For Rangers
- Focus on critical work (route maintenance, emergencies)
- Surge capacity (handle multiple issues via quests)
- Community engagement (trainers help their regions)
- Talent identification (recruit skilled questers)

## Risks & Regulations

### Safety Concerns
- Trainers may overestimate abilities (take quests beyond skill)
- Inadequate equipment (not prepared for conditions)
- Miscommunication (unclear quest parameters)
- Environmental hazards (weather, terrain)

**Safeguards:**
- Licensing (baseline competence)
- Difficulty rating system (clear warnings)
- Ranger oversight (verify completions, provide backup)
- Legal liability (trainers responsible for own safety)
- Natural selection (failure weeds out weak trainers)

### Fraud Prevention
- Badge cards verified (linked to database)
- Completion proof required (photos, witnesses, items)
- Ranger review (check work quality)
- Reputation tracking (repeat offenders banned)

### Quest Board Maintenance
- Pokemon Centers update boards daily
- Completed quests removed promptly
- Urgent quests highlighted (red paper, top of board)
- Old quests archived (reposted if still needed)

## Professional Quest-Takers

Some trainers make their living primarily through quests rather than League competition:

**Wilderness Specialists** - Focus on high-difficulty wilderness quests, many badges
**Urban Specialists** - Investigation and escort work in cities
**Rescue Specialists** - Focus on fainted Pokemon and lost trainer retrieval
**Type Specialists** - Leverage specific type expertise (Water-type for coastal quests)

**Income Potential (typical, varies by mix and region):**
- **Casual (1–2 E/D per week):** ₽1,000–3,000/month
- **Part‑time (3–5 mixed per week):** ₽3,000–9,000/month
- **Full‑time Professional (near‑daily mixed):** ₽10,000–30,000+/month
- **Elite Specialists (regular B/A‑class):** ₽30,000+/month

**Career Path:** Many [Rangers](../organizations/ranger-union.md) are recruited from successful professional quest-takers.

## Canon Divergence

**Official Pokemon Canon:**
Pokemon games and anime have occasional "quest" or "mission" elements, but no systematic job board structure. Most trainers earn money through battles and tournaments ([Bulbapedia - Trainer](https://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/Pok%C3%A9mon_Trainer)).

**Pokemon Amber:**
This story introduces a comprehensive quest system to explain how trainers who don't compete in the League earn money and how wilderness areas are maintained. It adds economic realism to the Pokemon world.

**Inspiration:**
- **Pokemon Mystery Dungeon** series features extensive mission boards where rescue teams take requests ([Bulbapedia - Mission](https://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/Mission))
- **Monster Hunter** series' quest board system
- Real-world freelance/gig economy concepts
