# Gym and Elite Badges

Badges are symbols of trust and recognition issued by gyms. They originated as marks of respect from type masters and were later co‑opted by the Pokemon League for tournament qualification. Badges represent local trust and mastery, not absolute power levels.

## Overview

**Core Principle:** A gym’s badge reflects the gym’s trust and respect for a trainer’s demonstrated competency with that gym’s specialty and values.

**Two Badge Tiers:**
- Standard **Gym Badge**: Earned by defeating a designated gym trainer or the leader on a standard challenge. Signals foundational competence and the gym’s respect.
- **Elite Badge**: Earned by defeating the Gym Leader’s primary team on an elite challenge. Signals exceptional mastery; holding ≥1 Elite Badge confers recognized “Ace Trainer” status.

**What Badges Represent:**
- ✅ Regional trust and acknowledgment by that gym
- ✅ Breadth of experience (more badges = more places and styles you’ve learned from)
- ❌ NOT a strict power ranking or linear progression

## How Badges Work

### Challenge Structure

**Standard (Gym Badge):**
- Register at reception (ID/license checked; scheduling as needed)
- Face the gym’s standard challenge (designated trainer or leader)
- Win → receive the gym’s badge; recorded to your trainer profile

**Elite (Elite Badge):**
- Invitation or request at reception; leaders gatekeep for safety and readiness
- Face the leader’s primary team and elite evaluation
- Win → receive the gym’s Elite Badge; recognized for Ace status

### Difficulty and Strategy
- Difficulty is fixed per gym based on local culture, values, and typical threats
- Trainers often start at approachable gyms and work up to harder ones
- Strong trainers may take on hard gyms or elite challenges earlier

### Gym Difficulty Landscape

Relative difficulty differs by gym; reputation comes from context rather than a formal tier list. A Cinnabar badge often implies surviving harsh fire‑type conditions; a Cerulean badge emphasizes water safety and control. Harder badges increase prestige, but do not strictly correlate to absolute strength.

## Earning a Badge

### Process

1. Register at reception (trainer license required; minors may need guardian consent)
2. Standard or Elite challenge scheduled
3. Evaluation focuses on control, type knowledge, safety, and gym philosophy
4. Pass → physical badge issued and recorded to trainer profile

### Failure and Retakes
- Waiting periods apply between attempts; gyms often suggest targeted training
- Administrative fees, if any, are nominal; gyms are subsidized for public service

## Quests (Economic Work)

Quests are freelance work posted at Pokemon Centers. Legally, quests require a valid trainer license. Quest posters may prefer or require specific badges for reputation, insurance, or skill fit, but badges are not a universal legal gate.

### Class Grades (Public Boards)
- Boards show Class E–A prominently; S‑Class is invite‑only and not posted
- Pay scales by class; trainers self‑select based on readiness

### Recommendations and Requirements
- Posters can specify preferred badges (e.g., “Boulder Badge preferred”), minimum team size, or experience
- Government and Ranger contracts commonly prefer Elite Badge holders for high‑risk work

## Pokemon League Paths

### Juniors League (U18)
- Qualify by earning 8 standard Gym Badges from League‑recognized gyms
- Elite Badges improve seeding/prestige but are not required

### Regular League (Open Age)
- Must hold ≥1 Elite Badge (confers Ace Trainer status) and meet a tournament ranking points threshold
- Elite Badges may grant seeding advantages and invitations to premier events

### Elite Four and Champion Consideration
- Holding 8 Elite Badges (from official pillar gyms) qualifies a trainer for Elite Four candidacy (rare)
- Defeating all four Elite Four permits a Champion challenge under League rules

### Champion Title (Separate System)
- Pokemon League results determine sporting titles; the regional “Champion” is a government appointment (separate career track)

## Legal Implications

### Licenses, Not Badges
- Wilderness travel is legal but risky; preserved areas require permits
- Quests require a valid trainer license (contracts, liability, insurance)
- Badges are credentials that affect reputation, hiring, and seeding—not legal access

## Historical Context

### Pre‑Modern Era (Before Pokeball Revolution)
- Badges began as personal trust and alliance between type masters and travelers
- Noble and guild youths undertook journeys, visiting many gyms to learn techniques
- Youth tourneys (U18) emerged to compare which disciples learned best

### League Co‑option and Standardization
- As the League formed, it adopted badges as proof of worthiness for competition
- Badge proliferation led to a conference with major gyms; “pillar” gyms were recognized and standardized
- Modern era preserves badges as trust marks and League qualifiers (Juniors: Gym Badges; Regular: Elite Badges + ranking)

## Regional Variations

- Kanto‑Johto recognizes a wide network of government‑approved gyms; League‑pillar gyms are a subset whose Elite Badges count for elite qualification
- Other regions vary in how many pillar gyms they recognize and how Elite Badges are treated

## Related Systems

- **[Gym System](./gym-system.md)** - Standard vs Elite challenges, operations, entertainment
- **[Trainer Licensing](./trainer-licensing.md)** - Legal ability to handle Pokemon and take quests
- **[Quest System](./quest-system.md)** - Job boards, difficulty, and contracting
- **[Ranger Union](../organizations/ranger-union.md)** - Government wilderness service
- **[Ace Trainers](../organizations/ace-trainers.md)** - ≥1 Elite Badge recognition and roles

## Common Misconceptions

- "More badges = stronger trainer"
  - Not necessarily. Badges show breadth of experience and recognized trust, not raw power
- "You need badges to legally work quests"
  - False. You need a trainer license; badges may be requested by posters
- "Elite Badge holders must be government employees"
  - False. ≥1 Elite Badge confers Ace status, which is often recruited for government work, but it’s not automatic employment

## Canon Divergence

**Official Pokemon Canon:**
Badges gate progression and obedience; there’s no formal dual‑tier (Standard/Elite) badge model or universal quest system.

**Pokemon Amber:**
Badges remain trust marks. The League co‑opts them for qualification. A dual model distinguishes Standard (Gym) vs Elite Badges, and quests operate via licensing rather than badges.

**Inspiration:**
- Historical guild trust marks
- Real‑world sports qualification and seeding
- Driver’s license vs competition credentials separation
