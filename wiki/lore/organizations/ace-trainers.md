# Ace Trainers (Recognition & Roles)

"Ace Trainer" is a recognition for trainers who hold at least one Elite Badge, earned by defeating a Gym Leader’s primary team on an elite challenge. It signals exceptional mastery and reliability.

## Recognition

- Definition: ≥1 Elite Badge
- Source: Awarded by gyms via elite challenges; tracked by League registry
- Prestige: Significant; often invited to high‑tier tournaments and special events
 - Typical team capability ~55; wide variance by specialty and region

## Roles and Opportunities

- Government support: Frequently contracted for emergency response or special operations
- Gym leadership: Eligible for consideration as gym leaders (not guaranteed; leaders are not always the strongest)
- Elite Four candidacy: Holding 8 Elite Badges (from pillar gyms) qualifies a trainer for consideration (rare)
- League seeding: Preferential seeding and invitations in the Regular League

## Responsibilities and Expectations

- Conduct: Expected to uphold gym and League standards in public
- Safety: Maintain high safety practices; mentor juniors when possible
- Readiness: Capable of responding to large‑scale incidents alongside Rangers and officials

## Distinctions

- Not automatic employment: Ace status does not make one a government employee
- Not purely combat: Mastery includes control, ethics, and judgment aligned with gym philosophies
 - Aura conduction: Aces typically demonstrate superior aura control with partners, enabling faster growth and safer high‑intensity recoveries

## Canon Divergence

- Defines Ace status via ≥1 Elite Badge rather than an independent exam/fee
- Ties recognition to gym‑issued elite challenges and League registry
