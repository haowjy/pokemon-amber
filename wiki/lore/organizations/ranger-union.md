# Ranger Union

The **Ranger Union** is an official organization from the Pokémon Ranger spin‑off series that supervises Pokémon Rangers across multiple regions (Fiore, Almia, Oblivia). It operates a headquarters in northwest Almia and is led by Chairperson Erma. Rangers in that canon use Capture Stylers rather than Poké Balls.

This page adapts the Ranger Union for the Amber continuity’s main‑series style worldbuilding (no Stylers; Poké Balls and League systems apply). Canon details from the Ranger games and animated specials are summarized below for reference, followed by our continuity’s interpretation.

## Canon provenance (spin‑off and animation)
- Existence and scope: The Ranger Union is named and described in the Pokémon Ranger series as the central body “supporting the activities of Rangers” and operating in Fiore, Almia, and Oblivia.
- Headquarters: Located in northwest Almia along Union Road, west of Altru Park; serves as the player’s Top Ranger base in Shadows of Almia.
- Leadership: Chairperson Erma is identified as the head who helped found the Union alongside Professor Hastings and Principal Lamont.
- Media appearances: The Ranger Union and its HQ also appear in the Pokémon Ranger: Guardian Signs animated special tied to the third game.
- Canon scope note: The Ranger series is official Pokémon media, but classified as a spin‑off continuity relative to the core main‑series games.

## Amber continuity adaptation (differences from spin‑off)
- Tools and methods: Replace Capture Stylers with standard Poké Balls and training practices consistent with main‑series mechanics.
- Mandate: Keep the mission (public safety between settlements) and upgrade their role as wilderness EMS/route wardens coordinating with city Police and League Gyms.
- Structure: Maintain recognizable ranks (Recruit → Ranger → Senior/Top Ranger → Regional Command) without Stylers/Operators/Mechanics roles; Operators become dispatchers posted at Centers.
- Quest linkage: Rangers post overflow work to Pokémon Center job boards; see [Quest System](../training/quest-system.md) for contracting and pay norms.
- Geography: While the original HQ is in Almia, Kanto/Johto field offices are plausible (Viridian, Pewter, Indigo corridor) for route maintenance and SAR calls.

## Overview (Amber continuity)
Rangers function as wilderness first‑responders—closer to firefighters/paramedics than police. They are distinct from the [police force](./police-force.md) (cities) and [Ace Trainers](./ace-trainers.md) (military/championship roles).

**Primary mission:** Maintain safe travel BETWEEN cities (Routes 1–25, Indigo corridor) so daily life and commerce can function.

**Core functions:**
- Route maintenance (clear hostile Pokémon from main paths; post warnings; monitor conditions)
- Infrastructure (assist with hazard signage, minor repair, storm cleanup)
- Search and rescue (lost travelers, injured trainers)
- Emergency response (wild outbreaks, natural disasters, accidents)
- Wildlife management (problem Pokémon threatening routes or farms)
- Quest coordination (post freelance work for supplementary tasks)

**Funding:** Public works budget akin to roads and fire services; supplemented by gym/municipal grants for peak seasons.

### Ranks (Amber continuity)
- Ranger Recruit: Field trainee under supervision (limited authority; cannot lead SAR)
- Ranger: Full field authority on marked routes and designated missions
- Senior Ranger: Leads SAR teams; certifies seasonal contractors; incident commander
- Top Ranger/Regional Command: Oversees multiple stations; inter‑region coordination during crises

### Interop
- Police: Urban incidents, arrests, forensics
- Gyms: Training standards; lend specialists for controlled culls
- Centers: Dispatch desk, medical hand‑off, job board interface

## Notes for authors
- When you reference “Ranger Union,” it is canon to Pokémon via the Ranger spin‑offs and anime tie‑ins, but adapted here to fit main‑series mechanics.
- If you need a named official beyond Kanto/Johto, Chairperson Erma is a valid cross‑continuity anchor; otherwise use local Ranger Captains/Commanders.

- Experience with different Pokemon types and threats
- Ability to travel and work in various areas
- Well-rounded competency (not just strong in one area)
- Proven track record across multiple gyms

### Application Process

1. **Application Submission** - Written application with experience summary
2. **Entrance Exams** - Written test (wilderness knowledge, emergency procedures, Pokemon behavior) and practical test (battle simulation, rescue scenario, navigation challenge)
3. **Pokemon Team Evaluation** - Rangers assess team's capabilities and training
4. **Interview** - Panel of senior Rangers and Station Chief
5. **Background Check** - Government security clearance
6. **Acceptance** - Enter training program if all stages passed

**Competitive:** Not everyone who applies is accepted. Rangers are elite wilderness specialists.

### Training Program

**Duration:** 6-12 months intensive course

**Components:**
- Classroom instruction (procedures, regulations, Pokemon ecology)
- Physical training (fitness, endurance, strength)
- Field training (wilderness exercises with supervision)
- Emergency response drills (search, rescue, fire, disaster)
- Mentorship (paired with senior Ranger)
- Practical examinations (scenarios testing all skills)

**Probationary Period:**
6 months after graduation working under supervision before full Ranger status confirmed.

**Washout Rate:** Significant - physically and mentally demanding, dangerous work, high standards.

## Day-to-Day Operations

### Route Maintenance

**Primary Responsibility:** Keep main roads and paths safe for regular traffic (cars, bikes, foot traffic)

**Activities:**
- Regular patrols (daily or weekly depending on route)
- Clear aggressive wild Pokemon (drive away, relocate, or calm)
- Repair route damage (rockslides, fallen trees, erosion)
- Monitor Pokemon populations (track territorial changes)
- Respond to traveler reports (aggressive Pokemon sightings)
- Post warnings (dangerous conditions, closures)

**Goal:** Enable commerce, travel, and daily life without Pokemon interference.

### Emergency Response

**Search & Rescue:**
- Lost trainers or civilians in wilderness
- Time-sensitive (especially if injured or in harsh weather)
- Coordinate search teams (multiple Rangers + possibly quest-taking volunteers)
- Aerial and ground search patterns
- Recovery and medical care

**Pokemon Attacks:**
- Aggressive wild Pokemon threatening people
- Calm, relocate, or defeat as appropriate
- Protect civilians until threat resolved
- Document incident for population management

**Natural Disasters:**
- Forest fires (coordinate firefighting, evacuate areas)
- Floods (rescue operations, route closures)
- Rockslides (clear routes, search for victims)
- Earthquakes (assess damage, rescue trapped individuals)

**Trainer Emergencies:**
- Injured trainers (provide first aid, evacuate)
- Fainted Pokemon abandoned (recover and return - see [fainting mechanics](../mechanics/pokemon-fainting.md))
- Equipment failure (lost in wilderness without supplies)

### Wildlife Management

**Population Monitoring:**
- Track wild Pokemon populations
- Identify territorial shifts
- Document migration patterns
- Research for government policy

**Problem Pokemon:**
- Unusually aggressive individuals
- Pokemon in wrong habitat (relocated)
- Overpopulation issues
- Territorial disputes affecting routes

**Ecosystem Protection:**
- Prevent habitat destruction
- Monitor endangered species
- Enforce wilderness regulations
- Coordinate with researchers

### Quest Coordination

**Why Rangers Post Quests:**

Rangers have limited capacity (only so many personnel) and can't handle everything simultaneously. The [quest system](../training/quest-system.md) extends their reach through freelance trainers.

**Common Ranger-Posted Quests:**
- Route clearing (aggressive Pokemon on low-priority paths)
- Census work (counting Pokemon populations in specific areas)
- Supplementary patrols (extra coverage during busy seasons)
- Resource gathering (data collection, plant samples)
- Non-emergency rescues (fainted Pokemon with no immediate danger)
- Specialized tasks (need type expertise Rangers lack)

**Ranger Involvement:**
- Post quests at [Pokemon Centers](../../pok-locations/celadon-city/celadon-pokemon-center.md)
- Review quest completions (verify work done properly)
- Issue payments (government funds)
- Provide quest details and support
- May recruit quest-takers for major operations

**Example Ranger Quests ([Chapter 7](../../../story/chapter7/chapter7.md)):**
- "[Ranger Request] Route 7 Spearow Flock Management (Moderate)"
- "[Ranger Request] Mt. Moon Wild Pokemon Census (Dangerous)"
- "[Ranger Request] Emergency - Lost Trainer (Dangerous) - URGENT"

## Ranger Stations

### Infrastructure

**Location:** Strategic wilderness locations (route entrances, crossroads, near major parks/forests)

**Typical Station Features:**
- Small office building (often rustic construction)
- Communication equipment (radio tower, emergency systems)
- Pokemon care facilities (healing machines, supplies)
- Rest quarters (Rangers on shift can sleep)
- Equipment storage (rescue gear, supplies)
- Vehicle/Flying-type landing area (if applicable)

**Staffing:** Usually 5-15 Rangers depending on area size and activity level.

**Coverage:** Each station responsible for regional area (routes, forests, wilderness zones).

### Station Locations

**Examples (Not Exhaustive):**
- Ranger Station 7 (Route 7 area, near Celadon - mentioned in quest format)
- Pewter Station (Mt. Moon and northern routes)
- Viridian Station (Viridian Forest, western Kanto)
- Various route and wilderness stations

**Proximity:** Often near [Pokemon Centers](../../pok-locations/celadon-city/celadon-pokemon-center.md) for coordination.

### Relationship with Other Organizations

**Police Force:**
- Coordinate on missing persons, crime in wilderness
- Clear jurisdiction (Police=cities, Rangers=wilderness)
- Joint task forces for major incidents
- Generally good working relationship

**Gyms:**
- Rangers post quests at gyms sometimes
- Gym-certified trainers take Ranger quests
- May coordinate on local ecosystem issues
- Professional respect (both serve public)

**Quest-Takers:**
- Rangers rely on freelancers for supplementary work
- Verify certifications (ensure safety)
- Build relationships with reliable questers
- May recruit successful quest-takers to become Rangers

**Ace Trainers:**
- Rangers and Aces both elite trainers
- Different roles (Rangers=wilderness service, Aces=military/championship)

## Compensation & Benefits

**Salary:** Government-funded, stable income

**Estimated Ranges (based on story economics):**
- Ranger Recruits: ₽40,000-60,000/month (training stipend)
- Standard Rangers: ₽100,000-150,000/month
- Senior Rangers: ₽150,000-250,000/month
- Station Chiefs: ₽200,000-300,000/month
- Regional Directors: ₽300,000+/month

**Benefits:**
- Health insurance
- Pokemon care covered (food, medical, supplies)
- Equipment provided
- Housing allowances (especially remote postings)
- Retirement pension
- Hazard pay for dangerous operations

**Comparison:**
- More stable than quest-taking freelance work
- Less potentially lucrative than elite League competition
- Comparable to other government emergency services

## Historical Context

**Formation:** Formalized after [Pokeball invention](../history/pokeball-invention.md) enabled government formation and professionalization of wilderness defense.

**Pre-Pokeball Era:**
- No centralized Rangers - gym councils handled all Pokemon threats
- Each gym responsible for their local area
- Ad-hoc coordination between gyms during crises
- Champion led unified defense efforts
- Informal guides and local experts supplemented gym efforts

**Post-Pokeball Government Era:**
When [governments formed from gym councils](../history/gym-evolution.md), wilderness defense was professionalized:
- **Ranger Union created** as dedicated wilderness emergency service
- Government funding (previously gym councils covered defense)
- Standardized training and procedures (replacing ad-hoc responses)
- Regional coordination (Rangers replaced gym council's role)
- Integration with [quest system](../trainer-systems/quest-system.md)

**Modern Rangers:**
Rangers now do what gym councils once did - but as professional, full-time service rather than guild members splitting duties. This freed gyms to focus on training and certification.

## Canon Divergence

**Official Pokemon Canon:**

Pokemon Ranger games ([Bulbapedia - Pokemon Ranger series](https://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/Pok%C3%A9mon_Ranger_(series))) feature:

- **No Capture Stylers** (Rangers use standard Pokeballs and permanent teams)
- Located in Kanto-Johto (main series region)
- Government emergency services model (more realistic)
- Integration with [quest system](../training/quest-system.md) (coordinate freelancers)
- Expanded detail on organization, training, operations

**Retained Concepts:**
- Ranger Union organization

## Story References

While Rangers haven't appeared directly in Chapters 1-9, they are frequently referenced:

- Quest system coordination ([Chapter 7](../../../story/chapter7/chapter7.md))
- "[Ranger Request]" quests on job board ([Chapter 7](../../../story/chapter7/chapter7.md))
- Implied presence maintaining routes
- Authority to check certifications (creates tension for uncertified Amber)
- Professional quest-takers aware of and coordinate with Rangers

Rangers will likely appear more directly in future chapters as Amber ventures into wilderness areas.
