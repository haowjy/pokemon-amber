# Kanto–Johto Unification and the Indigo Corridor (Amber Continuity)

## Overview
Kanto and Johto developed as distinct regions separated by the Indigo mountain range. Dangerous routes and limited communications kept cultures and governments apart. As transit slowly improved, both governments sought to control the strategic Indigo Corridor, culminating in a bloody border conflict and eventual unification treaty.

## Pre‑War Context
- Geography: The Indigo Plateau and passes formed a natural barrier; only expert trainers could reliably cross.
- Fragmented States: City‑state governance dominated; regional authorities were weak, alliances fluid.
- Trade Pressure: Safer crossings and growing demand for goods/League events increased pressure to formalize control.

## The Indigo Corridor Conflict (aka Unification War)
- Causes: Competing sovereignty claims over the corridor; customs control; League jurisdiction.
- Character: Skirmish‑heavy, prolonged standoff; Pokemon used in combined arms with strict League constraints.
- Civil Impact: Evacuations near passes; disrupted trade; surge in orphan care and Pokemon shelters.

## Treaty and Unification
- Terms: Joint League administration of the Indigo complex; shared customs; phased demilitarization of passes.
- Outcome: Kanto and Johto unify under a single federal structure with retained local autonomy; League gains formal cross‑region authority.
- Aftermath: Infrastructure programs (roads, relay towers); gradual normalization of travel.

## Timeline Notes (Tech/Comms)
- 1980s analogue (Arc era): Minimal cross‑region TV; limited trunk lines; ad‑hoc airfields; patchy enforcement.
- 1990s analogue (Journey era): Satellite relays, better roads, standardized IDs, stronger inter‑region bureaucracy.

## Relevance to Story
- Background to lax security in early chapters and inconsistent ID enforcement.
- Explains patchwork communications and the rise of airstrips with mixed transport (Pokemon flights, balloons, blimps).
- Post‑war prosperity: tourism booms at coastal hubs like Cinnabar; ad‑hoc terminals expand before formal airports.
- Sets stakes for League authority in later arcs.
