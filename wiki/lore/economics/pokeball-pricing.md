# Pokeball Economics & Pricing

Pokeballs represent one of the most significant technological achievements in the Pokemon world—and one of the most expensive barriers to becoming a trainer.

## Technology Overview

### What Makes Pokeballs Expensive

**Core Technology:**
- Matter-to-energy conversion system
- Indefinite storage with full life support
- Consciousness preservation during conversion
- Reusable (unless physically damaged or broken)
- Miniaturized Silph Co. proprietary systems

**Manufacturing Complexity:**
- Requires precision engineering at molecular level
- Each ball must maintain quantum stability
- Silph Co. holds near-monopoly on production
- Quality control failures can result in Pokemon injury/death

## Standard Pricing

### Market Rates (₽1 ≈ $1 USD)

**Pokeball**: ₽200 (~$200 USD)
- Standard capture device
- 1× base capture rate
- Suitable for most common Pokemon
- Most widely available

**Great Ball**: ₽600 (~$600 USD)
- Enhanced capture rate
- 1.5× base capture rate
- Required for stronger wild Pokemon
- Available in major cities

**Ultra Ball**: ₽1,200+ (~$1,200+ USD)
- Premium capture device
- 2× base capture rate
- Essential for rare/powerful Pokemon
- Limited availability, often requires permits

### Specialty Balls

**Master Ball**: Priceless
- Silph Co. executive/government use only
- Not available for public purchase
- Guaranteed capture (any Pokemon)

**Safari Balls, Lure Balls, etc.**: ₽300-800
- Specialized for specific conditions
- Limited availability to certain locations
- May have restrictions on use

## Economic Impact on Trainers

### Team Building Costs

**Minimum Investment:**
- 6 Pokemon team = minimum ₽1,200 in pokeballs alone
- Most trainers use mix of Pokeball/Great Ball = ₽200-600 each
- Realistic team cost: ₽1,500-3,000 in pokeballs

**Replacement Costs:**
- Broken balls must be replaced
- Lost Pokemon = lost ₽200+ investment
- Elite trainers may lose Ultra Balls (₽1,200 each)

### Why Team Building Is Gradual

**Financial Reality:**
- Beginner quests pay ₽50-200
- Takes 1-2 quests to afford ONE pokeball
- Building full 6-Pokemon team takes weeks/months
- Most trainers never reach 6 Pokemon

**Strategic Catching:**
- Can't spam balls at every Pokemon
- Must evaluate: "Is this worth ₽200?"
- Rare Pokemon sightings without available balls = heartbreak
- Trading becomes more valuable than catching

## Trainer License & Pokeballs

### What's Included with Standard Trainer License

**Included:**
- Trainer ID card
- Pokemon Center free healing access
- Legal permission to carry up to 6 Pokemon
- Quest board access

**NOT Included:**
- Pokeballs (must purchase separately)
- Pokedex (separate application/sponsorship)
- Starter Pokemon (sponsorship only)

### Junior Permit Differences

**Junior Permit (Age 10+):**
- Carry limit: 1 Pokemon only
- Same access (Pokemon Centers, quest board)
- Fee: ₽5-10 (nominal, not gatekeeping)
- Still requires pokeball purchase for any catches

## Economic Barriers

### Why Not Everyone Becomes a Trainer

**Upfront Costs:**
- First pokeball: ₽200 (if no sponsor/starter)
- Basic camping gear: ₽500-1,000
- Emergency supplies: ₽100-300
- Total barrier to entry: ₽800-1,500+

**Ongoing Costs:**
- Food (human + Pokemon): ₽30-100/day
- Pokeballs for team expansion: ₽200 each
- Medicine/antidotes: ₽20-50/item
- Equipment replacement: varies

**Sponsorship Advantage:**
- Professor Oak's starters come WITH pokeball (₽200+ value)
- Gym scholarships may provide pokeballs
- Wealthy families can afford full teams immediately
- Poor families rely on child earning their own pokeballs

## Black Market & Alternatives

### Illegal Pokeballs

**Knockoff Pokeballs:**
- ₽50-100 (cheaper than legitimate)
- Unreliable capture rates
- Risk of Pokemon injury
- May fail during storage
- Team Rocket suspected of producing/selling

**Stolen Pokeballs:**
- Full price on black market
- Risk of ownership disputes
- League tracks serial numbers
- Possession of stolen balls = criminal offense

### Legal Alternatives

**Breeding:**
- Family Pokemon breed offspring
- Offspring inherit parent's pokeball "lineage"
- Technically free Pokemon (no new ball needed if staying with family)

**Trading:**
- Pokemon already in balls can be traded
- Transfer of ownership, not new capture
- Popular alternative to catching

**Sponsored Pokemon:**
- Starters, gym gifts, quest rewards
- Come with pokeball included
- Prestigious and economically valuable

## Regional Variations

### Kanto Pricing (Current)

Standard pricing as listed above. Silph Co. headquarters in Saffron ensures steady supply but monopoly pricing.

### Other Regions

- Hoenn/Johto: Similar pricing (₽200/600/1200)
- Alola: Slight premium due to import costs
- Unova: Competitive market, slightly cheaper

## Historical Context

### Post-War Pokeball Shortage

- Production facilities damaged during the War
- Pokeball prices spiked to ₽500-1,000 for basic balls
- Black market thrived
- Orphaned children couldn't afford to catch Pokemon for protection
- League subsidies helped restore production

### Current Market

- Production mostly recovered
- Prices stabilized at ₽200 (still expensive for many)
- Silph Co. maintains effective monopoly
- Alternative manufacturers exist but limited market share

## Gameplay vs. Reality

**In Pokemon Games:**
- Pokeballs seem cheap (₽200 in-game currency)
- Trainers spam dozens of balls per catch
- Unlimited funds from trainer battles

**In This World:**
- ₽200 = $200 real-world value
- Each ball is serious investment
- Trainers carefully choose when to use balls
- Economic pressure shapes journey outcomes
