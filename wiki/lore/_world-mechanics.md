# World Mechanics & Universal Rules (Author-Only)

Purpose: Centralize consistent rules about how the Pokemon world works. These principles apply universally and guide all worldbuilding decisions. Unlike plot secrets, these are mechanical truths about the universe itself.

## Pokemon Sustenance & Battle Mechanics (Do Not Explicitly State)

### Core Principle
Pokemon sustain themselves primarily through battle. When a Pokemon wins a battle, something transfers from the defeated to the victor---call it essence, spirit, life force, or leave it unnamed. This exchange nourishes the victor and weakens the loser.

### Observable Effects (Can Show In-Story)
- Wild Pokemon are aggressive and territorial (seeking battles for sustenance)
- Pokemon that battle regularly are healthier and stronger
- Berries are used for healing and supplementary nutrition
- Pokemon rarely eat each other (unlike Earth predators)
- Fainted Pokemon are vulnerable and need rescue quickly
- Trained Pokemon thrive (regular controlled battles with recovery)
- Weak/losing Pokemon are driven to marginal territories

### Hidden Mechanics (Guide Worldbuilding, Don't State)
1. **Victory = Nourishment**
   - Winning a battle provides sustenance to the victor
   - Magnitude scales with opponent's strength
   - Multiple small victories or fewer large ones both work
   
2. **Defeat = Depletion**
   - Losing drains the Pokemon
   - Occasional losses are recoverable (with rest/berries)
   - Chronic losing leads to dangerous depletion
   
3. **Berries & Plants**
   - Provide healing and supplementary nutrition
   - Cannot fully replace battle sustenance for most species
   - Some herbivorous Pokemon can survive on berries longer
   - Fast-growing, abundant in Pokemon world
   
4. **Predation (Rare)**
   - Only extreme top predators truly need to eat other Pokemon
   - Usually only when battle opportunities scarce
   - Most Pokemon can go indefinitely on battle sustenance alone
   - Fainted Pokemon are vulnerable to opportunistic predation

5. **Humans Different**
   - Humans require conventional food/water
   - Not sustained by battles the same way
   - Can develop aura sensitivity with deep Pokemon bonds
   - Explains trainer/Pokemon distinction

### Population Balance Mechanisms
These keep wild Pokemon populations stable:

1. **Territorial Exclusion** - Strong Pokemon claim large territories, exclude others
2. **Battle Scarcity** - Dense areas = not enough battles to sustain all
3. **Migration Pressure** - Losers forced to leave or starve
4. **Predation on Weakened** - Fainted/chronically weak Pokemon are vulnerable
5. **Evolution Bottleneck** - Not all Pokemon can accumulate enough to evolve
6. **Human Intervention** - Catching, training, Rangers managing populations
7. **Seasonal Variations** - Berry cycles, migration patterns, breeding seasons

### Why This Matters for Story
- Makes rescue missions urgent (fainted = helpless, time-sensitive)
- Explains why trainers help Pokemon (controlled battles = healthy Pokemon)
- Justifies aggressive wild Pokemon (need victories)
- Creates stakes (can't recall fainted Pokemon, must flee or carry them)
- Makes dungeons/wilderness genuinely dangerous
- Explains quest system (population management needed)

## Pokemon Fainting Mechanics

### Core Rule
**Fainted Pokemon cannot be returned to their Pokeball.** They've depleted their capacity to dematerialize.

### Observable Facts (Can State)
- Fainted Pokemon must be carried physically
- Recovery takes hours to days depending on severity
- Pokemon Centers accelerate recovery significantly
- Fainted Pokemon in wilderness = extreme danger

### Hidden Mechanics (Guide Story)
- Fainting â‰  death (usually), but creates vulnerability window
- Without intervention, fainted Pokemon risk:
  - Predation by opportunists
  - Environmental exposure
  - Further depletion (if left too long)
- Recovery time varies by:
  - Species constitution
  - Severity of defeat
  - Environmental conditions
  - Access to berries/care

### Story Implications
- Getting overwhelmed means fleeing or abandoning fainted Pokemon
- Knocked-out trainers can't recall their team = disaster
- Rescue quests have genuine urgency (days matter)
- Strong trainers needed for deep wilderness (can't just run)
- Explains why people die in the wild (separated from conscious Pokemon)

## Pokeball Technology

### Historical Context
- Pre-Pokeball era: Pokemon training was rare, elite, dangerous
- Pokeball invention = "industrial revolution" for Pokemon world
- Initially crude, improved rapidly
- Modern balls: instant transport, accelerated healing, bond enhancement

### Effects on Pokemon
- Easier to catch and transport (obvious)
- Accelerated recovery when stored (ball provides rest environment)
- Bond with trainer strengthened over time (exposure to human aura)
- Pokemon become more receptive to training
- Some personality mellowing (debated in-universe)

### Effects on Society
- Explosion of trainers (previously elite profession democratized)
- Pokemon medicine advances (Centers can interface with balls)
- Tournament/League culture grows (safe transport enables competitions)
- Wild population management becomes necessary
- Power concentration (strong trainers much stronger with teams)

### Limitations
- Cannot recall fainted Pokemon (see above)
- Some legendary Pokemon resist/break balls
- Stolen balls still respond to original trainer (usually)
- Ball damage can trap Pokemon or release unexpectedly

## Ditto Species (General)

### Origin Theory (Public Knowledge)
Failed cloning attempts that persisted as unstable, shapeshifting entities. This is accepted scientific consensus but not definitive.

### General Capabilities
- Transform into observed Pokemon
- Most Dittos have obvious imperfections (proportions, faces, coloration)
- Struggle to copy strength (usually much weaker than original)
- Short-term transformations (minutes to hours)
- Require direct observation to copy (cannot remember long-term)

### Why Most Dittos Are Weak
- Failed clones from common Pokemon (Rattata, Pidgey, etc.)
- Instability prevents proper power retention
- Copy fidelity poor
- Used mostly for breeding or novelty

### Rare Strong Dittos
- Exceptionally rare
- Usually from failed clones of rare/powerful Pokemon
- Can retain more strength when transformed
- Better morphological fidelity
- May remember forms without constant observation
- Extremely valuable (government/criminal interest)

### Story Note
MC's Ditto is an extreme outlier (see plot secrets for why). Most Dittos encountered should be weak/imperfect like anime version.

## Aura & Human-Pokemon Bonds

### Basic Principles
- Deep bonds with Pokemon expose humans to their aura
- Over time, some humans develop aura sensitivity
- Extremely rare to develop overt "aura powers"
- Most sensitive people just have good intuition with Pokemon
- Requires years of close bonding, usually with childhood Pokemon

### Observable Effects (Rare)
- Reading Pokemon emotions accurately
- Calming aggressive Pokemon
- Sensing nearby Pokemon (vague)
- Occasional empathic flashes with bonded partners
- Enhanced reaction time in battle (reading partner intent)

### Extremely Rare (Named "Aura Guardians" historically)
- Projecting aura visibly
- Healing Pokemon through touch
- Sensing aura at distance
- Combat applications (Riley, Lucario movie)
- Usually hereditary + extensive training

### Story Guardrails
- Keep most trainer bonds mundane (trust, training, care)
- Occasional "I knew what my Pokemon needed" intuition moments
- Rare encounters with true aura users (treat as legendary-adjacent)
- MC may develop minor sensitivity (Mew DNA + deep bonds) but keep subtle

## Do/Don't Quick List

### Do
- Show consequences of these mechanics naturally
- Let characters experience effects without explaining them
- Use mechanics to create stakes and tension
- Keep most worldbuilding implicit (show, don't tell)
- Allow reader theories without confirmation

### Don't
- Don't exposit the battle-sustenance mechanic directly
- Don't make aura powers common or obvious
- Don't ignore fainting consequences for plot convenience
- Don't make Dittos uniformly strong
- Don't let Pokeballs break core mechanics (like recalling fainted Pokemon)

## Notes for Future Development
- Pokemon Center mechanics (how healing machines work)
- Type effectiveness beyond game mechanics (real biology?)
- Move learning vs instinct
- Evolution triggers and requirements
- Legendary Pokemon (do normal rules apply?)
- Regional variations in Pokemon behavior
- Breeding mechanics
- Shiny Pokemon rarity explanation
