# Hidden Lore & Story Mechanics (Author-Only)

Purpose: Centralize invisible rules that govern the story. These principles guide plotting and character behavior but are never stated diegetically. Treat this document as authoritative continuity.

## Core Pillars (Do Not Reveal In-Story)
- Human-clone success with preserved or imported consciousness is effectively non-replicable.
- The Mewtwo/Ambertwo success was “more luck than science” (trigger unknown); even Fuji doesn’t know the cause (see [Ch.6](./story/chapter6/chapter6.md) for in-text citation of his admission).
- Ambertwo carries trace Mew DNA; effects remain subtle and are never labeled in-story.

## Project Chimera (Team Rocket) – Operational Truths
- Team Rocket revives Project Chimera with one mandate: clone Mew into a controllable weapon (Mewtwo). Fuji accepts this as the necessary step to deepen cloning expertise for his personal goal (resurrect Amber). Mewtwo is an instrument, not his true end.
- In exchange for delivering on Mewtwo, Fuji is granted latitude for side experiments (human and Pokémon). The “two” prototypes (e.g., Charmandertwo, Bulbatwo) are constructed by spiking source genomes with trace Mew cells; the admixture destabilizes development and causes failure modes (morphological, metabolic, or behavioral).
- Public/organizational-facing framing: Mewtwo is the project goal. Private truth: Amber is the goal; Mewtwo is the stepping stone.

## Cloning & Consciousness – Hidden Rules
1. Pokémon cloning with Mew admixture
   - Stability ∝ genomic compatibility + protocol fidelity; Mew admixture confers transformative capacity but increases instability.
   - Most “two” lines will fail late-stage morphogenesis or present behavioral divergence; this is normal and expected.
2. Human cloning (general case)
   - Biological cloning alone does not preserve consciousness or personhood.
   - Ordinary conditions cannot reinstantiate a human mind; the result is a blank-slate nervous system.
3. Non-replicable success condition (Ambertwo/Mewtwo event)
   - A high-intensity psychic surge (Mewtwo awakening) coincided with a freshly severed human consciousness (the MC’s death) and an open, developmentally primed human clone (Ambertwo).
   - The conjunction acted as a one-time conduit. No deterministic protocol exists; Fuji cannot reproduce it.
   - Consequence: Fuji will never successfully create “another Amber” with a real consciousness, despite trying.

## Ambertwo – Trace Mew DNA (Subtle Effects)
- Psychic Resonance: slightly elevated sensitivity to strong psychic fields (Mew/Mewtwo). Portray as intuition, chills, or déjà vu—never as labeled “psychic power.”
- Biological Flex: marginally boosted adaptability under stress (recovery, plasticity). Keep within realistic bounds for a child.
- Recognition Hook: contributes to Mewtwo’s hesitation and recognition behavior around “Amber.”

## Ditto – Origin, Fidelity & Constraints
- Ontology: Dittos are failed clones. In most attempts, Pokémon cellular structures prove too unstable and collapse; what persists is a metastable, undifferentiated matrix capable of mimetic reconfiguration.
- Transform Capability: The ability to transform arises from the same instability that prevented proper differentiation. Fidelity scales with the quality/success of the underlying clone attempt.
- Common Ditto: Often exhibit obvious flaws (proportion errors, incomplete features, low power carryover), matching anime-like imperfections.
- MC’s Ditto: A failed Mew clone (legendary baseline). Because the source was Mew, this Ditto can: (a) transform into any Pokémon with high morphological fidelity, (b) retain near-source strength when transformed, and (c) remember/practice specific transformations without a live model present. Keep this exceptionalism rare and narrative-costly.
- Moral Resistance: Primed with a “protect Amber” schema; refuses lethal orders against innocents even under protocol triggers (seen in [Ch.12–16](../../story/chapter12/chapter12.md)). Treat as emergent training bias, not sapient ethics.
- Limits: Cannot copy non-physical attributes (memories, complex learned strategies) beyond immediate morphology/biomechanics; apparent “experience” reflects rehearsal and conditioning, not mind copy.

## Mewtwo – Human Admixture Consequences
- Holds grudges; interprets threats and betrayal through a human-like cognitive frame (per [Ch.6](./story/chapter6/chapter6.md)).
- Recognition Response: Exhibits protective/curious behavior around Ambertwo due to resonance + prior lab exposure patterns; do not overuse.
- Practical Guardrail: Mewtwo remains an off-screen, region-scale variable unless the plot specifically calls it in. Contact events should be rare and consequential.

## Fuji – Motivation & Limits
- Ultimate goal is personal: bring back Amber and “fix” his family. He rationalizes all other work through this lens.
- He believes process mastery is near; truth: his success was luck and won’t repeat. This fuels escalation and eventual breakdown.
- He will never accept non-replicability and will continue dangerous attempts that fail (sometimes catastrophically), but avoid gratuitous repetition on-page.

## Narrative Guardrails (Execution Notes)
- Never exposit these rules; show consistent outcomes.
- When effects manifest (e.g., resonance, Ditto refusal), present them as character beats or situational quirks.
- Keep Ambertwo’s advantages small, human-scaled, and costly; no overt “powers.”
- Maintain ambiguity so readers can form theories without confirmation.

## Citation Anchors (for internal consistency only)
- Fuji’s “more luck than science” admission: [Ch.6](../../story/chapter6/chapter6.md)
- Ditto resistance & protocol conflict: [Ch.12](../../story/chapter12/chapter12.md), [Ch.15–16](../../story/chapter15/chapter15.md), [Ch.16](../../story/chapter16/chapter16.md)
- Mewtwo recognition/behavioral framing: [Ch.1](../../story/chapter1/chapter1.md), [Ch.6](../../story/chapter6/chapter6.md)

## Do/Don’t Quick List
Do
- Keep replication failures off-screen unless they advance character or plot.
- Use sensory cues for resonance (sound drop, hair rise, nausea).
- Let Fuji misattribute failure to controllable variables (funding, sabotage, “bad batches”).

Don’t
- Don’t let any character meaningfully explain transmigration.
- Don’t allow a second successful human consciousness recreation.
- Don’t give Ambertwo overt psychic abilities or explicit Mew markers.
