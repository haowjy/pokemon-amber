# Cinnabar Island

## Overview
Cinnabar Island is a volcanic island in the Kanto region that secretly housed a major, high-tech laboratory run by [Team Rocket](./../factions/Team_Rocket.md).

## Canon Divergence
**Official Canon ([Bulbapedia](https://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/Cinnabar_Island)):** Cinnabar Island is known for its Pokémon Mansion (where Mewtwo research occurred), Cinnabar Gym, and volcanic activity. The island's Pokémon Mansion contains journal entries about Mew and Mewtwo research but is abandoned and partially destroyed.

**Pokémon Amber:** Focuses exclusively on the island as the site of active Team Rocket genetic research, with no mention of the gym, town, or other canonical features. The laboratory is portrayed as a large, sophisticated facility rather than the mansion ruins seen in games ([Chapter 1](../../story/chapter1.md)).

**Fan Theory Integration:** Builds on the established connection between Cinnabar Island and genetic experimentation, expanding the scope of research to include human cloning alongside Pokémon cloning.

## Key Areas
*   **Team Rocket Laboratory:** A large, hidden scientific facility headed by [Dr. Fuji](./../characters/Dr_Fuji.md). The lab's primary purpose was genetic research, specifically Pokémon cloning. It contained sophisticated equipment like cloning tanks and an "evolution acceleration chamber" ([Chapter 1](../../story/chapter1.md), [Chapter 6](../../story/chapter6.md)).

## Role in the Story
Cinnabar Island is the location where the story's inciting incident occurs. The laboratory was the site of the creation of [Mewtwo](./../pokemon/Mewtwo.md), [Ditto](./../pokemon/Ditto.md), and the [Amber](./../characters/Amber.md) clone. The facility was almost completely destroyed by Mewtwo during its violent escape ([Chapter 1](../../story/chapter1.md), [Chapter 6](../../story/chapter6.md)). Following this event, Team Rocket appears to have abandoned the location.
