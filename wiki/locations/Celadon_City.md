# Celadon City

## Overview
Celadon City is a major Kanto metropolis where [Amber](./../characters/Amber.md) experiences her first taste of freedom and becomes embroiled in the "Oddish Heist" adventure.

## Key Areas
*   **Celadon Gym:** A prestigious Grass-type gym with extensive gardens and training facilities ([Chapter 4](../../story/chapter4.md)). Its restricted greenhouses are used to cultivate plants for the gym's proprietary HP UP formula ([Chapter 8](../../story/chapter8.md)). The gym is run by senior trainer [Erika](./../characters/Erika.md) and junior trainer [Mary](./../characters/Mary.md).
*   **Dr. Fuji's Apartment:** A small apartment where [Dr. Fuji](./../characters/Dr_Fuji.md) kept Amber after bringing her from [Cinnabar Island](./Cinnabar_Island.md) ([Chapter 2-3](../../story/chapter2.md)).
*   **Residential District:** A lower-income area where Amber and Mary track the Oddish thief to a rundown apartment ([Chapter 10](../../story/chapter10.md)).

## Role in the Story
Celadon City serves as the setting for the story's first main arc. It is where Amber escapes Dr. Fuji's control, has her first Pokémon battle, and forms her first friendships with Mary and Erika. The events in Celadon lead directly to Dr. Fuji recapturing Amber and taking her to [Pallet Town](./Pallet_Town.md).

### Commercial District
Amber explores the bustling commercial areas of Celadon, which are described as being far cleaner and more pleasant than the residential district where she later hunts for the thief. It is here that she first encounters a real Pokémon battle ([Chapter 4](../../story/chapter4.md)).

### Celadon Department Store
A massive, multi-floor retail center that serves as a hub for trainers. The store sells a wide variety of goods, from TMs and evolution stones to high-end trainer fashion. It is a licensed vendor of the official, gym-certified vitamins like HP UP and Calcium.

### Game Corner District
An entertainment district known for its casinos, pawn shops, and a more disreputable crowd. The area is heavily patrolled by Meowth. The shops in this area are less regulated, and it served as the base of operations for Kaede, the Oddish thief.

### Factory Ward
An impoverished and polluted industrial area on the outskirts of the city. It is characterized by crumbling infrastructure and poor living conditions. This is the home of Kaede and her brother Hiro, and the site of a recurring "Sludge Fever" outbreak.
