# Ditto

## Overview
This Ditto is a unique, highly intelligent Pokémon that was created by [Dr. Fuji](./../characters/Dr_Fuji.md) and served as a companion and guardian to [Amber](./../characters/Amber.md).

## Canon Divergence
**Official Canon ([Pokémon Database](https://pokemondb.net/pokedex/ditto), [Bulbapedia](https://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/Ditto)):** Ditto is a Normal-type Transform Pokémon known for its ability to copy other Pokémon's appearance and moves, though typically with imperfect facial features. They are naturally occurring Pokémon found in various regions.

**Pokémon Amber:** This Ditto is artificially created as a failed Mew clone with perfect transformation abilities and human-level intelligence, making it far superior to natural Ditto ([Chapter 6](../../story/chapter6.md)).

**Fan Theory Integration:** Based on the popular fan theory that Ditto are failed Mew clones ([Fan Theory Wiki](https://fantheory.fandom.com/wiki/Ditto:_The_failed_Mew_clone_pokemon), [Reddit discussions](https://www.reddit.com/r/pokemonconspiracies/)), supported by their shared weight (19.8 lbs), similar coloration, and Transform ability. This theory, while unconfirmed officially, has widespread community acceptance.

## Origin
This Ditto is a failed clone of the mythical Pokémon Mew, created during [Dr. Fuji's](./../characters/Dr_Fuji.md) research for [Team Rocket](./../factions/Team_Rocket.md). The cloning attempt was deemed a failure because, while it could replicate a subject's form and power perfectly, it retained its own consciousness and could not be mentally controlled ([Chapter 6](../../story/chapter6.md)).

## Role in the Story
Ditto was assigned by Dr. Fuji to be [Amber's](./../characters/Amber.md) guardian in [Celadon City](./../locations/Celadon_City.md). It quickly evolved from a stoic protector into a loyal and playful friend ([Chapter 3](../../story/chapter3.md), [Chapter 7](../../story/chapter7.md)). It was later used as a weapon by Dr. Fuji in his murder of [Stephen Ketchum](./../characters/Stephen_Ketchum.md) ([Chapter 12](../../story/chapter12.md)).

## Abilities
This Ditto's abilities far exceed those of a normal member of its species.
*   **Perfect Transformation:** It can transform into perfect replicas of Pokémon and humans, without the flawed facial features typical of other Ditto. It has transformed into a Pidgeot ([Chapter 2](../../story/chapter2.md)), Amber ([Chapter 3](../../story/chapter3.md)), and a Gyarados ([Chapter 12](../../story/chapter12.md)).
*   **Power Replication:** When transformed, it can replicate the full powers and abilities of its target.
*   **Sentience:** It displays human-level intelligence, understanding complex situations and demonstrating emotions like loyalty and playfulness ([Chapter 7](../../story/chapter7.md)).

## Status
Its current status is unknown. It was last seen with Dr. Fuji following the murder of Stephen Ketchum ([Chapter 12](../../story/chapter12.md)).
