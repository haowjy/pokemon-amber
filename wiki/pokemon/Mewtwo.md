# Mewtwo

## Overview
Mewtwo is a legendary Pokémon, genetically engineered by [Dr. Fuji](./../characters/Dr_Fuji.md) for [Team Rocket](./../factions/Team_Rocket.md), and described as the "most powerful Pokémon ever created" ([Chapter 6](../../story/chapter6.md)).

## Canon Divergence
**Official Canon ([Bulbapedia](https://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/Mewtwo), [Pokémon Database](https://pokemondb.net/pokedex/mewtwo)):** Mewtwo's origin varies across media. In the games, it's created by unnamed scientists on Cinnabar Island. In the anime, Dr. Fuji creates it for Giovanni, and it destroys the laboratory upon awakening. The anime version shows Mewtwo as highly intelligent and conflicted about its existence.

**Pokémon Amber:** Follows the anime's basic origin story but focuses purely on Mewtwo as a destructive force rather than exploring its psychological development. The story emphasizes its role as a catalyst for other events rather than as a character in its own right ([Chapter 1](../../story/chapter1.md)).

**Fan Theory Integration:** Incorporates the established lore connecting Mewtwo to Mew cloning experiments, which also produced the failed Ditto clones in fan theory.

## Origin
Mewtwo was created on [Cinnabar Island](./../locations/Cinnabar_Island.md) using the DNA of the mythical Pokémon, Mew. The project, funded by [Giovanni](./../characters/Giovanni.md), was intended to create the ultimate weapon. Its development was accelerated in an "evolution acceleration chamber," resulting in uncontrollable power levels ([Chapter 6](../../story/chapter6.md)).

## Role in the Story
Mewtwo's awakening and violent escape serve as the inciting incident of the story. Upon becoming conscious, its psychic power overwhelmed the lab's containment systems, and it destroyed much of the facility before flying away ([Chapter 1](../../story/chapter1.md)).

## Status
Its current whereabouts are unknown. [Team Rocket](./../factions/Team_Rocket.md) leadership has chosen not to pursue it, opting instead to commission a new, more controllable clone ([Chapter 6](../../story/chapter6.md)).
