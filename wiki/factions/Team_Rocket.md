# Team Rocket

## Overview
Team Rocket is a powerful and secretive criminal organization operating in the Kanto region. Their primary goal appears to be world domination through the acquisition and creation of overwhelmingly powerful Pok√©mon. The organization is led by the calm and calculating [Giovanni](./../characters/Giovanni.md).

## Known Operations
*   **Genetic Research:** Team Rocket's most significant operation revealed so far is its cloning program, which was spearheaded by [Dr. Fuji](./../characters/Dr_Fuji.md). This research led to the creation of [Mewtwo](./../pokemon/Mewtwo.md) and a unique [Ditto](./../pokemon/Ditto.md) ([Chapter 6](../../story/chapter6.md)). They have also developed forced evolution and battle-enhancement serums ([Chapter 6](../../story/chapter6.md), [Chapter 15](../../story/chapter15.md)).
*   **Known Bases:** Their primary research facility was a secret laboratory on [Cinnabar Island](./../locations/Cinnabar_Island.md), which was destroyed. It is also implied that the Celadon Game Corner serves as a front for their activities ([Chapter 5](../../story/chapter5.md)).

## Role in the Story
Team Rocket serves as the overarching antagonistic force that funded and enabled Dr. Fuji's research. The escape of their creation, Mewtwo, is the inciting incident of the entire story. Following the destruction of their lab, Giovanni and the Team Rocket administration have shifted their focus to creating a new, more controllable clone rather than pursuing Mewtwo ([Chapter 6](../../story/chapter6.md)).
