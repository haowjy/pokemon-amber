This article details the major historical events that occurred prior to the beginning of *Pokemon: Ambertwo*. This history provides the crucial context for the political landscape, the deep-seated regional tensions, and the societal structures that define the world at the start of the narrative.

## The Age of Unity: The Indigo Dominion

For centuries, the regions of **[[Geography and Environment#Kanto Region | Kanto]]** and **Johto** existed as a single, unified nation. Governed from the symbolic heart of the **Indigo Plateau** near the shared border of Mt. Silver, this era was marked by a common culture. A central part of this shared heritage was the **[[Society, Systems, and Technology#The Gym Challenge (Public Path) | Gym Challenge]]**, an ancient tradition where trainers journeyed across both lands to prove their worth.

The most significant technological leap of this era was the invention of the modern **Poké Ball**. Before its creation, trainers could only form lifelong bonds with one or two partners. The Poké Ball revolutionized this relationship, allowing for the capture, training, and easy transport of full teams of Pokémon. This innovation, while peaceful in its intent, inadvertently set the stage for warfare on an unprecedented scale.

## The Seeds of Conflict: A Growing Divide (~30 to 25 years ago)

Despite their shared history, Kanto and Johto began to drift apart.

*   **Cultural and Technological Rift:** Kanto became a hub of rapid technological innovation and scientific advancement, fostering a culture that valued progress and power. In contrast, Johto remained deeply connected to its history, traditions, and legends.
*   **The Shift in Power:** For many years, the title of Indigo Champion was held by a powerful and respected Johtoan family (the Dragonthrone clan that **Lance** belongs to). This political balance was shattered when a young Kantonian trainer, **[[Professor Samuel Oak | Samuel Oak]]**, demonstrated an unprecedented mastery of the new, six-Pokémon team format and himself being a master of a few Dragons. Where many trainers still struggled to command more than a few Pokémon with true synergy, Oak possessed a unique talent for forming deep bonds and executing complex strategies with a full team of powerful partners. His strategic genius and the profound loyalty he inspired in his Pokémon allowed him to rise through the ranks and decisively defeat the Johtoan Champion.
*   **The Secessionist Movement:** Oak's victory, a testament to his revolutionary training philosophy, became a powerful symbol for a growing secessionist movement within Kanto. Arguing for their region's technological superiority and now holding the Champion's seat, influential Kantonian factions began to push for independence from what they viewed as the "stagnant" traditions of Johto.

## The Indigo War: The First Poké Ball War (~25 to 20 years ago)

Fueled by political ambition and cultural friction, Kanto officially declared its secession, triggering the devastating **Indigo War**. This was the first major conflict fought since the invention of the modern Poké Ball, and its scale was horrific.

*   **A New Kind of Warfare:** For the first time in history, armies consisting of trainers with full teams of six Pokémon clashed on the battlefield. The destructive potential was immense, leading to massive casualties on both sides and scarring the landscape for years to come.
*   **Key Figures in the Conflict:**
    *   **Champion Samuel Oak:** As Kanto's Champion, he served as a military commander and the public face of the secessionist war effort.
    *   **Dr. Fuji:** A brilliant Kantonian researcher, he was recruited to lead the top-secret **Project Chimera**, tasked with creating genetic advantages for the Kanto military.
    *   **Stephen Ketchum:** A patriotic Kantonian soldier and skilled trainer, he fought on the front lines and witnessed the war's brutality firsthand, losing most of his beloved Pokémon team in the conflict.

## The Post-War Reconstruction: A New Order (~20 years ago to Present)

After five years of bloody conflict, **Johto emerged as the decisive victor.** Kanto's forces were defeated, and a new political order was established under the terms of the peace treaty.

*   **The Fall of a Champion:** As a key condition of Kanto's surrender, Samuel Oak was forced to abdicate the Champion's throne. This political humiliation marked the end of his competitive career and spurred his transition into full-time Pokémon research, eventually founding his lab in [[Geography and Environment#Pallet Town | Pallet Town]].
*   **The Rise of a Dynasty:** To solidify their victory and restore the previous political balance, Johto installed **Lance**, the son of the former Johtoan Champion Oak had defeated, as the new Champion of the entire region.
*   **The Independent Indigo League:** To prevent future conflicts, the old system was dismantled. A new, independent **Indigo League** was established as a joint governing body for both Kanto and Johto, designed to be politically neutral.
*   **The Ace Trainer Program:** The rules for **[[Society, Systems, and Technology#The Ace Trainer Program (Professional Path) | Ace Trainers]]** were re-established under the authority of the new Indigo League. The program now serves as a joint defensive force for both regions, its members tasked with protecting the populace from major threats rather than serving the nationalist ambitions of a single region.

This is the world that the story's characters inhabit: one officially at peace, but built on a foundation of recent, devastating war. The political scars, personal traumas, and lingering resentments from the Indigo War continue to shape the actions of everyone from disgraced scientists to retired veterans.
