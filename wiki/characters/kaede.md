# Kaede

## Overview
Kaede is a teenage girl living in Celadon City's Factory Ward who becomes entangled with Amber and Mary during a desperate attempt to save her sick younger brother. Despite being severely allergic to Grass-type Pokémon, she steals an Oddish from Celadon Gym in hopes of using its spores to help her brother Hiro, who suffers from Sludge Fever. Her character is based on Kaede from the manga *How I Became a Pokémon Card*.

## Canonical Source

### Manga: How I Became a Pokémon Card
Kaede originates from the manga series *How I Became a Pokémon Card* ([Bulbapedia](https://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/Kaede)), where she is characterized by several key traits that this story adapts:

**Friendship with Erika:** Kaede is childhood friends with Erika, the Celadon Gym Leader. Despite their different life paths, they remain close friends, with Erika seemingly unaware of Kaede's darker affiliations.

**Severe Allergies:** Kaede is severely allergic to pollen, flowers, and Grass-type Pokémon in general. She is frequently depicted sneezing, looking tired, and clutching her runny nose due to these allergies.

**Team Rocket Affiliation:** In the original manga, Kaede is a member of Team Rocket, though Erika remains oblivious to this fact. This creates an interesting dynamic where their friendship persists despite Kaede's criminal connections.

**Pokémon Partner:** Despite her crippling allergies, Kaede's only Pokémon is a Grass-type. She first met an Oddish as a young girl, and it later evolved into Gloom. The Oddish/Gloom carries around tissue boxes for her frequent sneezing fits and cares deeply for Kaede despite her allergic reactions to it.

## Pokemon Ambertwo's Interpretation

This story adapts Kaede's character with several key modifications while maintaining her core traits:

**Sympathetic Circumstances:** Rather than being introduced as a Team Rocket operative, this version presents Kaede first as a desperate older sister trying to save her sick younger brother. Her criminal actions (stealing the Oddish) stem from poverty and desperation rather than organizational loyalty.

**Healthcare Crisis:** The story adds context of systematic healthcare failure---her brother Hiro cannot receive treatment without "proper registration," highlighting issues of poverty and bureaucratic barriers. This desperation drives her to steal the Oddish and attempt to recreate HP UP, despite having no pharmaceutical knowledge.

**Factory Ward Setting:** Kaede lives in Celadon's Factory Ward, an impoverished industrial district suffering from pollution-related illnesses like Sludge Fever. The environmental health crisis makes her brother's condition part of a larger systemic problem rather than an isolated tragedy.

**Allergies as Sacrifice:** Her severe allergies to the stolen Oddish's spores emphasize the sacrifice she's making for her brother---she's literally making herself sick to keep him alive, spending every moment in constant discomfort with red, running eyes and relentless sneezing.

**No Initial Team Rocket Connection:** Unlike the manga, this version doesn't establish Kaede as a Team Rocket member during her introduction. Whether she has such connections remains unexplored, allowing for potential future development.

**Preserved Friendship:** Like the manga, Kaede's childhood friendship with Erika remains central to her character, creating emotional complexity when Erika must respond to the theft while still caring about her old friend.

## Role in the Story

### Chapter 5: The Theft
Kaede makes her first appearance in the story's final moments, though she isn't identified by name. Amber encounters her at the Celadon Gym grounds as she flees with the stolen Oddish ([Ch.5](../../story/chapter5/chapter5.md)):
- Characterized by constant sneezing and allergic symptoms (flushed face, red running eyes)
- Carrying an unconscious Oddish (wilted, drooping, with swirling eyes from a fall)
- In such a hurry that she crashes into Amber, apologizes briefly, then disappears
- Leaves visible golden spore trails in her wake

This brief encounter establishes her as a mystery figure who will become important later.

### Chapter 9: The Chase
Kaede is properly introduced when Mary and Amber track down the stolen Oddish. Their investigation leads them through Celadon's item shops, where multiple merchants remember a "desperate-looking girl" with "red-rimmed eyes" asking questions about HP UP production ([Ch.9](../../story/chapter9/chapter9.md)):

**The Confrontation:** Mary and Amber find Kaede in a shop near the Game Corner, where a merchant reveals her plan to use the stolen Oddish's spores to recreate HP UP. When discovered, Kaede flees through back alleys, leaving golden spore trails.

**The Capture:** Mary's Bellsprout trips Kaede during the chase. When captured, she immediately begs not to be sent to jail, crying that her brother will die without her help---establishing that her theft wasn't for profit but desperation.

**Motivations Revealed:** Through tears and panic, Kaede explains that her brother needs help but they lack the resources for proper treatment, setting up the humanitarian crisis at the story's emotional core.

### Chapter 10: Resolution
Kaede's situation is resolved when Mary and Amber bring Erika to help ([Ch.10](../../story/chapter10/chapter10.md)):

**Brother's Condition:** Kaede lives in a cramped apartment (mattress in corner, milk crate furniture, cardboard-patched window) in the Factory Ward. Her six-year-old brother Hiro suffers from Sludge Fever, a pollution-related illness spreading through their impoverished district.

**Hospital Rejection:** Hospitals refused treatment without "proper registration," leaving Kaede with no legal options. Her attempted theft and HP UP recreation were born from pure desperation.

**Misguided Plan:** Kaede reveals she thought HP UP could "extend his life," showing her lack of pharmaceutical knowledge. Mary explains that HP UP doesn't work that way and could have made Hiro even sicker, highlighting how desperation led to dangerous misconceptions.

**Oddish's Choice:** The stolen Oddish refuses to return to the gym, insisting on staying to help Hiro with its Sweet Scent and spore therapy. The Pokémon's agency and compassion become central to resolving the situation.

**Erika's Compassion:** Upon seeing the conditions and diagnosing Sludge Fever, Erika:
- Provides proper herbal treatment for Hiro's condition
- Allows the Oddish to stay with Kaede's family
- Requires Hiro to visit the gym's medical wing for ongoing treatment
- Offers the care for free (the herbs "grow in our greenhouse anyway")
- Asks Kaede not to mention it to anyone due to "gym procedures"

**Continued Suffering:** Even during treatment, Kaede's allergies persist---she continues sneezing throughout the scene, making it clear that keeping the Oddish means ongoing physical suffering for her. Yet she expresses overwhelming gratitude, showing the depth of her love for her brother.

### Chapter 11: Aftermath
Kaede's story concludes with the successful resolution of her brother's illness, though the chapter's details focus more on other plot developments.

## Personality

**Fiercely Protective:** Kaede's defining trait is her willingness to sacrifice everything for her younger brother. She commits theft, endures constant allergic reactions, and risks imprisonment---all to keep Hiro alive.

**Desperate but Not Criminal:** While she steals and considers dangerous improvisations (using HP UP on a human), these actions stem from impossible circumstances rather than moral failing. When given proper help, she immediately accepts it with gratitude.

**Self-Sacrificing:** Her allergies make every moment with the Oddish physically miserable, yet she never considers giving it up if it helps her brother. She literally makes herself sick to keep him comfortable.

**Resourceful:** Despite having no pharmaceutical training, she researches HP UP production, tracks down the Oddish she believes is key, and attempts to solve an impossible problem with limited resources.

**Ashamed but Determined:** When caught, she immediately shows remorse and fear of consequences, but her determination to save Hiro overrides everything else. She begs not to go to jail because Hiro needs her, not because she fears punishment.

## Physical Appearance

**Age:** Approximately 14-15 years old

**Allergic Symptoms:** Constantly displays severe allergic reactions:
- Red, puffy, running eyes
- Frequent explosive sneezing ("Ah-CHOO!")
- Flushed face with visible discomfort
- Runny nose requiring constant wiping
- Generally sickly appearance

**General Appearance:** Described as "desperate-looking" and appearing exhausted, likely from caring for her sick brother while suffering constant allergic reactions.

**Spore Trail:** When carrying the Oddish, she leaves visible trails of golden spores in her wake, making her relatively easy to track despite her attempts to flee.

## Relationships

**Hiro (Brother):** Her six-year-old brother suffering from Sludge Fever. Kaede's entire arc revolves around saving him. She sits by his side refusing to move, holds his hand during his illness, and risks everything for his survival. Their bond is the emotional core of her character.

**Erika:** Childhood friends, though their relationship isn't explored in depth during Kaede's chapters. Erika's willingness to bend gym rules to provide free treatment suggests their friendship remains strong despite their different life circumstances. Erika trusts Kaede enough to allow continued access to gym medical facilities.

**The Stolen Oddish:** Despite her severe allergies to it, Kaede develops a bond with the Oddish through their shared goal of helping Hiro. The Oddish shows surprising agency and compassion, choosing to stay with Kaede's family rather than return to the gym. It carefully releases therapeutic spores over Hiro while Kaede suffers the allergic consequences.

**Mary & Amber:** Initially adversarial (they chase and capture her), but Mary's approach remains compassionate throughout. Mary (a Celadon Gym trainer, based on Cooltrainer Mary from the [games](https://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/Celadon_Gym)) listens to her story, brings help rather than just turning her in, and explains why her HP UP plan would have failed. This kindness likely prevents Kaede from becoming a repeat offender.

## Living Conditions

Kaede lives in Celadon City's Factory Ward, an impoverished industrial district suffering from environmental pollution. Her apartment exemplifies the poverty of the area:
- Single room barely qualifying as an "apartment"
- One mattress in a corner serving as the only bed
- Hot plate balanced on milk crates as the entire kitchen
- Single window partially covered with cardboard
- Late afternoon light cutting through in harsh strips
- Industrial fan drones and mechanical sounds fill the air outside
- Grimy windows and weathered concrete define the neighborhood

The Factory Ward itself is characterized by:
- Failing neon signs advertising "MIRACLE CURES" and "INSTANT HEALING"
- Decrepit buildings with minimal maintenance
- Poverty-related crime and desperation
- Meowth with matted fur and tarnished coins (contrast to the sleek patrol pairs in wealthier districts)
- Grimers thriving in urban decay
- Air quality so poor it contributes to widespread Sludge Fever cases

## Medical Context: Sludge Fever

Sludge Fever is presented as a pollution-related illness "spreading through the Factory Ward again," suggesting:
- It's a recurring crisis in impoverished industrial areas
- Environmental factors (likely Poison-type pollution from factories) cause or exacerbate it
- The illness is serious enough that Erika recognizes it immediately and treats it as urgent
- Systemic healthcare failure means poor families like Kaede's cannot access treatment
- Proper treatment exists (Erika's herbal remedies work) but is denied due to bureaucratic barriers

This context frames Kaede's theft as a symptom of larger social problems rather than individual moral failing.

## Status

**Resolved** - Kaede's immediate crisis is solved through Erika's intervention. Her brother Hiro receives proper treatment for Sludge Fever, the Oddish is allowed to stay with their family, and Kaede has access to ongoing medical support through the gym (though she continues suffering allergic reactions). She faces no legal consequences for the theft, as Erika handles the situation compassionately rather than punitively.

## Thematic Significance

Kaede's character serves multiple thematic purposes:

**Healthcare Critique:** Her story exposes the cruelty of healthcare systems that deny treatment based on bureaucratic requirements rather than medical need. A child suffers from a treatable illness simply because his family lacks "proper registration."

**Desperation vs. Criminality:** The story challenges simple notions of theft and criminality by showing how impossible circumstances can drive good people to break laws. Kaede isn't a villain---she's a victim of systemic failure.

**Sacrifice and Love:** Her willingness to endure constant physical suffering (allergic reactions) for her brother's sake demonstrates the depths of familial love. Every sneeze, every watering eye, represents a choice to prioritize Hiro over her own comfort.

**Compassion in Action:** Erika's response---providing free treatment, bending rules, trusting Kaede despite the theft---models how institutional power can be used compassionately rather than punitively. Her "don't mention this to anyone" suggests she's aware she's breaking gym procedures but prioritizes human welfare over rules.

**The Pokémon-Human Bond:** The Oddish's choice to stay with Hiro despite being stolen creates interesting questions about Pokémon agency and compassion. The Pokémon recognizes genuine need and chooses to help, suggesting deeper emotional intelligence than simple obedience.

**Amber's Perspective:** As someone from a world with modern healthcare, Amber's reaction to learning about medical access barriers adds another layer of critique. Her expectation of "cheerful jingles at Pokemon Centers" for healing contrasts sharply with the reality of human healthcare in this world.

## Connections to Broader Lore

**Class Division in Celadon:** Kaede's story highlights the stark inequality within Celadon City. The same city that hosts the massive Department Store, luxury shopping districts, and the Game Corner's entertainment also contains factory wards where children die from treatable illnesses due to poverty.

**Gym Social Role:** Erika's willingness to provide free medical care (while hiding it from official procedures) suggests gyms may serve unofficial social welfare functions in their communities, even when formal systems fail.

**Environmental Consequences:** Sludge Fever's connection to industrial pollution implies that Celadon's economic prosperity (factories, manufacturing) comes at the cost of environmental health in poor neighborhoods. The wealthy shopping districts and struggling factory wards are connected---one literally sickens the other.

## Future Potential

While Kaede's immediate arc concludes in Chapter 10, several threads remain unexplored:

- Her childhood friendship with Erika could be developed further
- The manga's Team Rocket connection remains unaddressed---does that affiliation exist in this version?
- Her ongoing relationship with the Oddish (and her continued allergies) could provide future story opportunities
- The Factory Ward's systemic problems persist even after Hiro receives treatment
- Kaede's gratitude to Mary and Amber could lead to future assistance or friendship

The character remains available for future development while providing a complete emotional arc in her initial appearance.
