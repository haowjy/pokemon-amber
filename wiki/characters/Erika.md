# Erika

## Overview
Erika is a calm, authoritative, and highly respected senior trainer at the [Celadon City Gym](./../locations/Celadon_City.md#celadon-gym), and is the leading candidate to become the next official Gym Leader ([Chapter 10](../../story/chapter10.md)).

## Role in the Story
Erika serves as the ultimate authority figure during the "Oddish Heist" arc. She correctly theorizes the motive behind the theft is related to the gym's proprietary HP UP formula ([Chapter 8](../../story/chapter8.md)). Instead of punishing the thief, she shows deep compassion by diagnosing and treating the thief's sick brother with her knowledge of herbal medicine, providing the expensive cure for free ([Chapter 10](../../story/chapter10.md)).

## Partner Pok√©mon
*   She is seen battling with a **Weepinbell** and **Tangela** ([Chapter 10](../../story/chapter10.md)).
