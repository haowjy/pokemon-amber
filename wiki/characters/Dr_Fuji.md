# Dr. Tenma Fuji

## Overview
Dr. Fuji is the primary antagonist of the story. He is a brilliant but unstable geneticist, formerly of [Team Rocket](./../factions/Team_Rocket.md), who created [Mewtwo](./../pokemon/Mewtwo.md) and the clone of his daughter, [Amber](./Amber.md).

## Canon Divergence
**Official Canon ([Pokémon Wiki](https://pokemon.fandom.com/wiki/Dr._Fuji), [Bulbapedia](https://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/Dr._Fuji)):** In the anime, Dr. Fuji is a grief-stricken scientist who attempts to clone his deceased daughter Amber but fails. He works with Team Rocket to create Mewtwo and is killed when Mewtwo destroys the laboratory. In the games, he appears only as unnamed researchers in journal entries.

**Pokémon Amber:** Dr. Fuji successfully clones his daughter and survives Mewtwo's escape. He becomes a major antagonist who commits murder and engages in extended psychological manipulation. His relationship with Delia Ketchum and role as a former professor are original additions ([Chapters 11-16](../../story/chapter11.md)).

**Fan Theory Integration:** Builds on the anime's portrayal of Dr. Fuji as a grief-driven scientist, but extends his story far beyond the original scope to explore the psychological consequences of successful human cloning.

## History
Dr. Fuji was once the partner of [Delia Ketchum](./Delia_Ketchum.md), with whom he had a daughter, Amber. After their daughter died of cancer, Fuji's grief twisted into a monomaniacal obsession with cloning, which led to his separation from Delia ([Chapter 11](../../story/chapter11.md)). He joined [Team Rocket](./../factions/Team_Rocket.md) and used their resources to spearhead the research that created [Mewtwo](./../pokemon/Mewtwo.md) and a unique [Ditto](./../pokemon/Ditto.md) ([Chapter 6](../../story/chapter6.md)), while secretly creating a clone of his daughter ([Chapter 1](../../story/chapter1.md)). He was also formerly a tenured professor at Celadon University ([Chapter 16](../../story/chapter16.md)).

## Role in the Story
After [Amber](./Amber.md) escapes his control in [Celadon City](./../locations/Celadon_City.md), he tracks her down and takes her to [Pallet Town](./../locations/Pallet_Town.md) to confront Delia ([Chapter 11](../../story/chapter11.md)). After being rejected, his instability escalates, leading him to murder [Stephen Ketchum](./Stephen_Ketchum.md) ([Chapter 12](../../story/chapter12.md)). This culminates in [The Pallet Town Confrontation](./../events/The_Pallet_Town_Confrontation.md), where he battles [Professor Oak](./Professor_Oak.md) and is ultimately defeated ([Chapter 15-16](../../story/chapter15.md)).

## Personality
Dr. Fuji is driven by a deep-seated obsession and grief. He is arrogant, manipulative, and prone to fits of violent rage when he does not get his way. His scientific genius is overshadowed by his emotional instability and lack of morality.

## Relationships
*   **[Amber](./Amber.md):** The clone of his daughter. He sees her not as a person, but as a replacement for the original, to be controlled.
*   **[Delia Ketchum](./Delia_Ketchum.md):** His ex-partner. He harbors a lingering obsession with her, wanting to force her back into the family life they lost.
*   **[Team Rocket](./../factions/Team_Rocket.md):** His former employers. He used their resources for his personal projects.

## Pokémon
Dr. Fuji commands a team of powerful Pokémon, including a Magmar he enhances with an illegal serum and a uniquely intelligent [Ditto](./../pokemon/Ditto.md).

## Status
Dr. Fuji was apprehended by the Pallet Town Police following his battle with Professor Oak and is currently in custody ([Chapter 17](../../story/chapter17.md)).
