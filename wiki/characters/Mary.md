## Role in the Story
Mary is characterized by her diligent and rule-abiding nature. She initially apprehends [Amber](./Amber.md) as a suspect in the theft of an Oddish ([Chapter 8](../../story/chapter8.md)). After realizing Amber is innocent, she enlists her help, and the two work together to track down the real thief across the city ([Chapter 9](../../story/chapter9.md)). She ultimately makes the compassionate choice to bring in her superior, [Erika](./Erika.md), rather than simply arresting the culprit ([Chapter 10](../../story/chapter10.md)).
