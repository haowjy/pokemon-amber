# Amber

## Overview
Amber is the protagonist of the story. She is the consciousness of a 20-year-old college student from a parallel world who was transferred into the genetically-engineered clone of Dr. Fuji's deceased daughter ([Chapter 1](../../story/chapter1.md)).

## Canon Divergence
**Official Canon ([Pokémon Wiki](https://pokemon.fandom.com/wiki/Amber)):** In official Pokémon media, "Amber" refers to Dr. Fuji's daughter who died in a car accident and was unsuccessfully cloned as "Ambertwo" in the anime's extended material. The clone was unstable and eventually died.

**Pokémon Amber:** The protagonist is an original character - a college student from our real world whose consciousness successfully inhabits a stable clone of Dr. Fuji's daughter. This represents a major departure from canon by featuring both successful human cloning and an isekai protagonist from outside the Pokémon universe ([Chapter 1](../../story/chapter1.md)).

**Fan Theory Integration:** Incorporates the concept of human cloning from the anime's Mewtwo origin story, expanding it into a successful procedure rather than the failed attempts shown in official media.

## History
In her original life, Amber was a college student and an avid Pokémon fan who was killed in a traffic accident ([Chapter 1](../../story/chapter1.md)). Her consciousness awoke in a cloning tank on [Cinnabar Island](./../locations/Cinnabar_Island.md) during the escape of [Mewtwo](./../pokemon/Mewtwo.md). Believing her to be his resurrected daughter, [Dr. Fuji](./Dr_Fuji.md) took her to an apartment in [Celadon City](./../locations/Celadon_City.md) where he kept her isolated ([Chapter 2](../../story/chapter2.md)).

## Role in the Story
Feeling trapped, Amber escaped the apartment with her guardian Pokémon, [Ditto](./../pokemon/Ditto.md) ([Chapter 3](../../story/chapter3.md)). She soon became embroiled in the "Oddish Heist," where she worked with Celadon Gym trainers [Mary](./Mary.md) and [Erika](./Erika.md) to clear her name and find the real thief ([Chapters 5-10](../../story/chapter5.md)).

This adventure led to [Dr. Fuji](./Dr_Fuji.md) discovering her deception. He took her to [Pallet Town](./../locations/Pallet_Town.md) to confront his ex-partner, [Delia Ketchum](./Delia_Ketchum.md) ([Chapter 11](../../story/chapter11.md)). During [The Pallet Town Confrontation](./../events/The_Pallet_Town_Confrontation.md), Amber revealed her true identity to Dr. Fuji, which contributed to his mental breakdown ([Chapter 15](../../story/chapter15.md)).

## Personality
Amber is resourceful, brave, and empathetic, but also carries the trauma of her past life and "rebirth." She is prone to anxiety but pushes through her fear to do what is right. She has a deep knowledge of the Pokémon world from her life as a fan, which she uses to her advantage.

## Relationships
*   **[Dr. Fuji](./Dr_Fuji.md):** Her creator and initial caretaker. Their relationship is complex and fraught, defined by his obsessive control and her desire for freedom.
*   **[Ditto](./../pokemon/Ditto.md):** Her guardian and first true friend in the new world. They share a close, protective bond.
*   **[Mary](./Mary.md) & [Erika](./Erika.md):** Her first allies. They acted as mentors during her time in Celadon City.
*   **The Ketchum Family:** After being abandoned by Dr. Fuji, she was taken in by [Stephen](./Stephen_Ketchum.md), [Delia](./Delia_Ketchum.md), and [Ash Ketchum](./Ash_Ketchum.md) ([Chapter 13](../../story/chapter13.md)).

## Possessions
*   **[Ditto](./../pokemon/Ditto.md):** Her partner Pokémon, entrusted to her by Dr. Fuji.

## Status
Amber is currently residing at [Professor Oak's](./Professor_Oak.md) lab with the Ketchum family ([Chapter 17](../../story/chapter17.md)).
