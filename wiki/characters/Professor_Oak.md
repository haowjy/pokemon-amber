# Professor Samuel Oak

## Overview
Professor Samuel Oak is the resident Pokémon Professor of [Pallet Town](./../locations/Pallet_Town.md), a globally respected researcher, and a former Pokémon League Champion ([Chapter 16](../../story/chapter16.md)).

## Canon Divergence
**Official Canon ([Bulbapedia](https://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/Professor_Oak), [Pokémon Database](https://pokemondb.net/pokedex/professor-oak)):** Professor Oak is established as a Pokémon researcher and former trainer, but his Champion status varies by media. In the Pokémon Adventures manga, he's confirmed as a former Champion, while in the games and anime this is less explicit.

**Pokémon Amber:** Professor Oak is definitively portrayed as a former Kanto Champion with an active, powerful team capable of defeating dangerous opponents. His willingness to engage in violent combat and his connection to Dr. Fuji's academic past are original elements ([Chapter 16](../../story/chapter16.md)).

**Fan Theory Integration:** Incorporates the widely-accepted fan interpretation that Professor Oak was once a Champion-level trainer, supported by his knowledge, reputation, and references in various Pokémon media.
