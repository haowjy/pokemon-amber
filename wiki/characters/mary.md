# Mary (Gym Trainer)

## Overview
Mary is a young Celadon Gym trainer who serves as one of Erika's trusted staff members. She becomes one of Amber's first friends in this world after catching her trespassing in the gym's restricted greenhouse. Mary plays a central role in resolving the Oddish theft mystery and demonstrates compassion for those in difficult circumstances. Her character is based on Cooltrainer Mary from the Celadon Gym in the core Pokémon games.

## Canonical Source

### Games: Cooltrainer Mary
Mary is based on the Cooltrainer named Mary who appears in the Celadon Gym across multiple Pokémon games ([Bulbapedia](https://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/Celadon_Gym)). In the games, she serves as one of Erika's gym trainers.

**Canonical Team (varies by game):**
- Bellsprout♀ Lv.22
- Oddish♀ Lv.22
- Weepinbell♀ Lv.22
- Gloom♀ Lv.22
- Ivysaur♂ Lv.22

In the games, Cooltrainers are typically portrayed as experienced trainers who are skilled in battle and serve as one of the tougher challenges before facing the Gym Leader.

## Pokemon Ambertwo's Interpretation

This story significantly expands Mary's role from a simple gym battle opponent into a fully realized character:

**Age and Experience:** Portrayed as approximately 15 years old, suggesting she's relatively new to her position as gym trainer despite her skill. This youth makes her friendship with 10-year-old Amber feel more natural.

**Compassionate Authority:** While maintaining her role as an authority figure at the gym, Mary demonstrates remarkable compassion. She doesn't immediately report Amber for trespassing, listens to Kaede's desperate situation, and consistently chooses understanding over punishment.

**Suspension Subplot:** Unlike the games, this Mary is under suspension for unspecified reasons, preventing her from taking official gym battles. Erika hints that solving the Oddish theft might help her case with "the board," suggesting internal gym politics.

**Pokemon Team Development:** At the start of the story, Mary primarily uses her Bellsprout partner. She doesn't yet have the full team from the games (specifically missing Ivysaur), suggesting room for growth as a trainer.

**Bridge Character:** Mary serves as a narrative bridge between Amber's outsider perspective and the gym's internal workings, helping readers understand how the gym operates beyond simple battles.

## Physical Appearance

**Age:** Approximately 15 years old

**Hair:** Purple, pulled back in a neat ponytail

**Attire:** Celadon Gym uniform - a forest green kimono-style top with darker trim and asymmetrical closure. The uniform features an embroidered Rainbow Badge on the chest, marking her as official gym staff.

**Demeanor:** Generally professional and authoritative when in her official capacity, but softens considerably when dealing with children or difficult situations. Shows practiced confidence in her movements and speech.

## Personality

**Authoritative but Kind:** Mary balances her role as gym authority with genuine compassion. She enforces rules (stopping Amber's trespassing) while recognizing when circumstances call for mercy (not reporting her).

**Professionally Frustrated:** Her suspension from official battles clearly bothers her. She watches other trainers with longing and shows eagerness to solve the Oddish case to restore her standing.

**Investigative and Determined:** When tasked with finding the stolen Oddish, Mary demonstrates methodical investigation skills, questioning merchants and piecing together clues about Kaede's movements.

**Protective of Children:** Consistently shows concern for Amber's safety and wellbeing. Hesitates to bring her into the Game Corner district, warns her about dangers, and ensures she stays close during their investigation.

**Compassionate Pragmatist:** Understands that sometimes breaking rules is justified by circumstances. Rather than simply arresting Kaede, she listens to the full story and brings Erika to help solve the underlying problem.

**Curious but Professional:** Shows fascination with Amber's unusual Ditto but doesn't press for details or report the strange transforming Pokémon to authorities.

## Role in the Story

### Chapter 5: First Encounter
Mary's introduction occurs when she catches Amber trespassing in a restricted greenhouse ([Ch.5](../../story/chapter5/chapter5.md)):

**Initial Confrontation:** Discovers Amber watching two Gloom (one being Ditto in disguise) playing together in the restricted greenhouse. Her initial authority ("What are you doing in here?") establishes her as a gym official.

**Ditto Discovery:** Witnesses Ditto's transformation wavering, revealing its pink form. Shows obvious fascination ("What... what kind of Pokemon is that?") but quickly returns to her professional role.

**Gentle Authority:** Upon realizing Amber is a young child without parental supervision, Mary's approach softens considerably. She gives a warning about "Do Not Enter" signs rather than reporting the trespassing.

**Missed Connection:** The two part ways after this encounter, but the moment establishes Mary's character as someone who balances rules with compassion.

### Chapter 7-8: [Expanded Role - Details TBD based on chapter content]

### Chapter 9: The Investigation
Mary takes the lead in investigating the Oddish theft, with Amber accompanying her ([Ch.9](../../story/chapter9/chapter9.md)):

**Erika's Assignment:** After hearing about the theft, Erika tasks the suspended Mary with finding the missing Oddish, hinting this could help her case with the board. Mary's eagerness to take the assignment shows both professional ambition and genuine care for the gym's Pokémon.

**Investigation Skills:** Methodically works through Celadon's item shops and herbalists, interviewing merchants about suspicious customers. Demonstrates detective-like questioning techniques while maintaining friendly rapport with shop staff.

**Coffee Incident:** Shows protective concern when Amber insists on drinking coffee despite Mary's warnings. After Amber's predictable caffeine overreaction ("I told you the coffee was a bad idea"), Mary remains patient rather than judging.

**Game Corner District Reluctance:** Hesitates to bring Amber into the area behind the Game Corner, explicitly warning about "a different crowd" and expressing concern about people who might "get interested in a Ditto." Shows understanding of local dangers.

**The Chase:** When they overhear Kaede's conversation about stealing the Oddish, Mary immediately takes action, shouldering past Amber to confront the situation. During the chase, she demonstrates battle skills by commanding Bellsprout to trip Kaede with vine techniques.

**Compassionate Capture:** Rather than immediately arresting Kaede, Mary takes time to understand the situation ("Your brother? Tell us about him."). Her steady, calm approach helps de-escalate Kaede's panic.

### Chapter 10: Resolution
Mary helps resolve the Oddish theft case with compassion rather than punishment ([Ch.10](../../story/chapter10/chapter10.md)):

**Verification of Truth:** Accompanies Kaede to her apartment, where she assesses the situation and verifies Kaede's story about her sick brother. Her experience as a trainer helps her recognize genuine need versus manipulation.

**Bringing Help:** Rather than making a unilateral decision, Mary recognizes she needs Erika's authority and expertise. She leaves Kaede with instructions to stay put and returns with the gym leader.

**Educational Moment:** Explains to Kaede why HP UP wouldn't work for humans and could even be dangerous ("our bodies aren't made to handle those kinds of compounds"). Provides crucial information that prevents future dangerous attempts.

**Supporting Role:** Assists Erika with treatment preparation, holding equipment and providing extra hands during the medical intervention. Shows she's learned practical skills beyond just Pokémon battles.

**Quiet Approval:** Mary "carefully keeps her face turned away from Erika" while smiling about the compassionate resolution, suggesting she approves of bending rules for humanitarian reasons but doesn't want to influence Erika's decision.

### Chapter 11: [Aftermath - Details TBD]

## Pokémon Team

### Bellsprout (Primary Partner)
Mary's most frequently seen Pokémon, used throughout the story:

**Battle Skills:** Demonstrates precise control with vine-based moves:
- Wrap techniques (used to trip and capture Kaede during the chase)
- Movement alongside Mary without requiring pokéball containment
- Shows intelligence in understanding complex commands

**Personality:** The Bellsprout appears well-trained and responsive, moving "silently alongside" Mary during tense situations. Its vine wrapped around a rusty railing while climbing stairs suggests either caution or protectiveness.

**Bond:** The Bellsprout's constant presence outside its pokéball suggests a strong bond with Mary, similar to how Ash's Pikachu typically stays outside.

### Future Team
Based on the canonical Cooltrainer Mary, she will likely acquire:
- Oddish → Gloom (possibly one of the gym's Pokémon)
- Weepinbell (evolution of current Bellsprout)
- Ivysaur (notably absent in current story, suggesting room for character growth)

The story notes she "doesn't have Ivysaur yet," implying potential future development.

## Relationships

**Erika (Gym Leader):** Mary serves under Erika and clearly respects her authority. However, their relationship shows complexity:
- Erika trusts Mary enough to assign investigation duties despite her suspension
- Erika speaks to Mary with gentle reminders rather than harsh commands ("you know you're still suspended")
- Erika hints that good performance could help Mary's case, suggesting she wants Mary to succeed
- The unspecified reason for suspension creates tension in their otherwise positive relationship

**Amber (MC):** Develops from authority figure to friend:
- First encounter involves catching Amber trespassing, but Mary chooses understanding over punishment
- Takes Amber along on investigation despite concerns about safety
- Warns Amber about coffee and local dangers, showing protective instincts
- Pays for Amber's train tickets and gives her coins as "quest reward"
- The relationship demonstrates Mary's capacity to look past rules to see individuals

**Kaede:** While initially adversarial (chasing and capturing her), Mary's approach remains compassionate:
- Listens to Kaede's full story rather than immediate arrest
- Brings help instead of just applying punishment
- Educates Kaede about HP UP dangers, preventing future harm
- Her kindness likely prevents Kaede from repeating criminal behavior

**The Gym's "Board":** An unnamed authority within the gym hierarchy that has suspended Mary. Their presence suggests internal politics and oversight beyond just Erika's personal authority. Mary's eagerness to solve the Oddish case to improve her standing with this board shows she values her position.

## Status and Suspension

**Current Status:** Suspended from official gym battles and duties

**Evidence of Suspension:**
- Erika reminds Mary: "You know you're still suspended until further notice" ([Ch.9](../../story/chapter9/chapter9.md))
- Mary watches active trainers battling challengers with visible longing
- Erika suggests solving the Oddish theft "might help your case with the board"

**Reason for Suspension:** Not explicitly stated in the story, creating an interesting mystery. Possibilities include:
- Rule violation (perhaps similar to her eventual bending of rules for Kaede?)
- Failed duty or responsibility
- Conflict with gym policies or the board
- Political/internal gym conflicts

**Impact:** The suspension clearly frustrates Mary, as evidenced by her gaze "drifting to one of the security monitors where trainers gathered for the afternoon's challenges, lingering just long enough to betray her longing."

## Thematic Significance

**Compassionate Authority:** Mary represents the possibility of authority figures who enforce rules while maintaining humanity. She demonstrates that "law and order" can coexist with understanding and mercy.

**Youth and Responsibility:** At 15, Mary occupies an interesting space between childhood and adulthood. She has official authority but still shows the idealism and compassion that might fade with age. Her youth makes her relatable to Amber while still representing institutional power.

**Redemption Through Service:** Her suspension creates a redemption arc where she must prove her worth through investigation and problem-solving rather than battle prowess. This values different forms of competence.

**Bridge Between Worlds:** Mary connects multiple social spheres:
- The gym's internal hierarchy (authority)
- Amber's outsider perspective (friendship)
- Kaede's desperate poverty (compassion)
- Celadon's various districts (local knowledge)

**Rules vs. Right:** Mary's character explores when rules should be bent or broken. She trespasses Amber with warnings rather than reports, supports Erika's rule-breaking free treatment, and consistently chooses humanitarian outcomes over bureaucratic correctness.

## Future Potential

Several narrative threads remain open for Mary's continued development:

**Suspension Resolution:** Will she regain her full status? What caused the suspension? How will solving the Oddish case affect her standing?

**Team Development:** Her missing Ivysaur and potential for evolving Bellsprout into Weepinbell suggest growth opportunities as a trainer.

**Erika Relationship:** The complexity of their mentor/subordinate dynamic could be explored further, especially regarding the mysterious "board" and internal gym politics.

**Friendship with Amber:** As one of Amber's first friends in this world, Mary could continue serving as a guide and ally.

**Professional Growth:** As she gains experience and age, will Mary maintain her compassionate approach or become more rigid with authority?

The character remains rich with potential for future story development while having completed a satisfying arc in the Oddish theft storyline.

## Character Development Arc

Mary's character demonstrates growth even within the limited chapters of her introduction:

**Initial State:** Professional gym trainer focused on rules and proper behavior, though naturally inclined toward kindness.

**Catalyst:** The suspension creates frustration and eagerness to prove herself, making her receptive to taking on the investigation.

**Challenge:** The Oddish theft investigation exposes her to Celadon's darker sides (Game Corner district, Factory Ward poverty, systemic healthcare failures) and forces her to confront that sometimes following rules creates worse outcomes than breaking them.

**Growth:** Mary learns to trust her compassionate instincts over rigid rule-following, supporting Erika's decision to provide free treatment despite "gym procedures."

**Resolution:** Successfully solves the case through investigation rather than battle prowess, demonstrating competence in multiple domains while maintaining her humanity.

This arc positions Mary as a positive role model for how authority can be wielded with wisdom and compassion rather than simple power.
