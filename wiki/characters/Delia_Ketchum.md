# Delia Ketchum

## Overview
Delia Ketchum is a resident of [Pallet Town](./../locations/Pallet_Town.md), the mother of [Ash Ketchum](./Ash_Ketchum.md), and the ex-partner of [Dr. Fuji](./Dr_Fuji.md).

## Role in the Story
Delia's past relationship with Dr. Fuji is a primary catalyst for the story's events. Years ago, after their daughter, Amber, died of cancer, she left Fuji due to his growing obsession with cloning ([Chapter 11](../../story/chapter11.md)).

In the present, Dr. Fuji confronts her with the cloned [Amber](./Amber.md), attempting to force a reunion. Delia firmly rejects the clone, triggering Fuji's violent breakdown ([Chapter 11](../../story/chapter11.md)). Her house is destroyed during [The Pallet Town Confrontation](./../events/The_Pallet_Town_Confrontation.md), and she is currently taking refuge at [Professor Oak's](./Professor_Oak.md) lab, unaware that Dr. Fuji has murdered her husband, [Stephen Ketchum](./Stephen_Ketchum.md) ([Chapter 17](../../story/chapter17.md)).
