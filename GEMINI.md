# Gemini Project: Pokemon Ambertwo

This file provides context for Gemini to understand and assist with the "Pokemon: Ambertwo" creative writing project.

## Directory Overview

This repository contains a Pokemon fanfiction story, "Pokemon: Ambertwo," written with the assistance of AI. The project is structured to facilitate AI collaboration, with dedicated directories for the story, a detailed wiki for world-building, and style guides for the AI.

-   **`story/`**: Contains the chapters of the story, with each chapter in its own numbered folder (e.g., `chapter1/`). Each folder includes the chapter markdown file (`1chapter.md`), author notes (`_1notes.md`), and a summary (`_1summary.md`).
-   **`wiki/`**: A comprehensive wiki for the story's lore, characters, locations, and plot arcs. This serves as a knowledge base to maintain consistency.
-   **`.cursor/rules/`**: Contains style and formatting guidelines for the AI writing assistant.
-   **`future/`**: A brainstorming and exploration space for future story direction, including potential plot threads, character ideas, and long-term story arcs.

## Key Files

-   **`README.md`**: The main entry point for understanding the project, its goals, and structure.
-   **`story/chapter*/*.md`**: The individual chapter files, written in Markdown.
-   **`wiki/**/*.md`**: The wiki files, which provide detailed information about the story's world and characters.
-   **`CLAUDE.md`**: Provides specific instructions for the Claude AI, which can be adapted for Gemini.
-   **`.cursor/rules/**/*.mdc`**: Markdown files with rules and styles for the AI.

## Usage

This is a creative writing project. The primary tasks are:

-   **Writing and editing chapters**: Creating new chapters and refining existing ones based on the established story and style.
-   **Maintaining the wiki**: Updating the wiki with new information as the story progresses to ensure consistency.
-   **Following style guides**: Adhering to the writing style and formatting conventions defined in the `.cursor/rules/` directory.

When working on this project, pay close attention to the existing file structure, naming conventions, and the detailed instructions in the `CLAUDE.md` file and the `.cursor/rules/` directory.
