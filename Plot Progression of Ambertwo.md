This article provides a detailed, chronological summary of the events of the *Pokemon: Ambertwo* narrative, beginning from the protagonist's arrival in the Pokémon world.

## Act 1: Rebirth and a New Reality

This act establishes the protagonist's core conflict and introduces the fundamental rules and tone of this altered Pokémon world.

*   **Chapter 1: Truck-kun Strikes Again:** The story begins with the protagonist, a 20-year-old college student, dying in a traffic accident while playing a Pokémon mobile game. She awakens in a cloning tank on [[Geography and Environment#Cinnabar Island | Cinnabar Island]], inhabiting the body of a 10-year-old girl. She quickly learns she is a clone of **[[Amber (Protagonist) | Amber Fuji]]**, the deceased daughter of the lead scientist, **[[Dr. Fuji]]**. Her awakening coincides with the escape of a powerful, newly created **[[Mewtwo]]**. Dr. Fuji, overjoyed and believing his daughter has been successfully resurrected, escapes the collapsing laboratory with her.
*   **Chapter 2: All Aboard!:** Dr. Fuji and Amber travel from Cinnabar Island to [[Geography and Environment#Celadon City | Celadon City]] via a "Pidgeot Express," a commercial flight service using trained Pidgeot. The protagonist experiences the wonder and overwhelming reality of seeing Pokémon in person for the first time.
*   **Chapter 3: Into the World of (Pocket) Monsters:** Now living in a Celadon apartment under Fuji's suffocating watch, the protagonist—now "Amber"—struggles with her new body and the frilly dresses Fuji insists she wear. She begins to bond with her guardian **[[Ditto]]**, teaching it to transform into more practical forms and starting a physical training regimen to cope with her boundless energy.
*   **Chapter 4: Achievement Unlocked! First Battle!:** Amber sneaks out with Ditto to explore Celadon. In a park near the [[Celadon Gym]], she is goaded into her first real Pokémon battle by a young trainer named Joey. Using her advanced game knowledge, she commands Ditto to transform into a Rattata and strategically defeat her opponent, winning her first Pokedollars.
*   **Chapter 5: A Perfectly Normal Gym Session:** Amber attempts to challenge the Celadon Gym but finds the entry fee far too expensive. While exploring the gym's outer gardens, she wanders into a restricted greenhouse. There, her Ditto playfully transforms into a Gloom, leading to her discovery and confrontation by a gym trainer named **[[Mary]]**.

## Act 2: The Celadon City Investigation

This act expands the world and supporting cast through a self-contained mystery plot, while simultaneously developing Dr. Fuji as the primary antagonist.

*   **Chapter 6: Scientist Fuji:** The perspective shifts to Dr. Fuji. His morning routine reveals his obsessive need to perfectly recreate his dead daughter's life. He attends a meeting at a secret [[Team Rocket]] facility beneath the Celadon Game Corner, where the fallout from Mewtwo's escape is discussed. His connection to the criminal organization and his cold, clinical demeanor are established. The chapter ends with him receiving information on the whereabouts of his ex-wife, **[[Delia Ketchum]]**.
*   **Chapter 7: Side Quests Galore:** Amber is accused of stealing an **[[Oddish]]** from the gym's greenhouse. She is brought to the Pokémon Center, where she is publicly confronted by Mary.
*   **Chapter 8: Start of an Unpaid Side Quest:** Amber is taken to the Celadon Gym's security office for questioning. She meets the aspiring Gym Leader, **[[Erika]]**. Using Ditto's transformation ability to prove her innocence and provide a likeness of the real thief, Amber convinces Erika to let her assist in the investigation.
*   **Chapter 9: Side Quest: Trade Secrets:** The investigation begins. Amber and Mary visit the Celadon Department Store and various herbalist shops, gathering clues. They learn that a sickly-looking girl has been asking about the secret formula for HP UP, a product exclusively licensed by the Celadon Gym.
*   **Chapter 10: Side Quest: Complete!:** Amber and Mary track the thief, **[[Kaede]]**, to the seedy district behind the Game Corner. They discover her motive: her younger brother, **[[Hiro]]**, is critically ill with "Sludge Fever," and she stole the Oddish in a desperate attempt to create a cure. Erika intervenes, providing proper medical treatment and allowing Kaede to keep the Oddish. The act concludes with Amber receiving a small reward from Mary, only to be immediately confronted and captured by a furious Dr. Fuji on a train platform.

## Act 3: The Pallet Town Inferno

The story's tone shifts dramatically from adventure to horror, raising the stakes from personal freedom to life and death.

*   **Chapter 11: Pallet Town:** Dr. Fuji forcibly takes Amber to the peaceful community of [[Geography and Environment#Pallet Town | Pallet Town]]. There, they confront Delia Ketchum, who is revealed to be Fuji's ex-wife. She has built a new life with her husband, **[[Stephen Ketchum]]**, and their 10-year-old son, **[[Ash Ketchum]]**. Delia vehemently rejects the clone, revealing the real Amber died of cancer. Fuji, enraged, abandons Amber at the Ketchum residence.
*   **Chapter 12: A Very Reasonable Man:** The perspective shifts back to Dr. Fuji. Consumed by rage and delusion after his rejection, he stalks Stephen Ketchum on a forest path. He ambushes Stephen, murdering him and his Poliwag in a brutal, one-sided battle using his Ditto and Magmar.
*   **Chapter 13: Sweet Home:** Amber is taken in by the Ketchum family. She spends a day bonding with a young, pre-journey Ash, helping him with his homework and witnessing the warmth of his family life before the tragedy has been discovered.
*   **Chapter 14: Flowers for Delia:** Dr. Fuji returns to the Ketchum home at night, intending to "reclaim" Delia. When she doesn't answer, he has his **[[Magmar]]** burn the house down.
*   **Chapter 15: Electabuzz v Magmar:** A brutal battle ensues between Stephen's partner Pokémon, **[[Electabuzz]]**, and Fuji's Magmar. Fuji uses a **[[Forced Evolution Serum]]** on his Magmar. Despite a valiant effort, Electabuzz is defeated and mercilessly executed by Magmar in front of Amber and Ash.
*   **Chapter 16: Dr. Fuji v Professor Oak:** Just as Fuji turns his attention to Amber and Ash, **[[Professor Samuel Oak]]** arrives. He sends the children to safety on his **[[Dragonite]]** and engages Fuji in a high-stakes battle, pitting his team of veteran Pokémon against Fuji's enhanced Magmar and Ditto. The battle rages, destroying the neighborhood and leaving the immediate outcome uncertain.
