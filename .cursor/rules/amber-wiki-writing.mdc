## Core Requirements

### 1. Canon Divergence Documentation
**All canon claims must be internet-researched and cited with URLs.**

**Required for all articles:**

- Minor characters: Divergence info in "Overview" 
- Pokemon: Note behavioral/origin differences from canon

### 2. Fan Theory Integration
- Label clearly: "Based on the fan theory that..."
- **Must research and link sources** (Reddit, forums, fan wikis)
- Note community acceptance level

### 3. Source Priority
1. Anime canon / movie canon (primary) 
2. Game canon (secondary)
3. Manga canon (tertiary) - but still important
4. little pieces of other official lore (like pokemon cards, etc.)
5. fan theories (quaternary) - but still important

## Research Process

**Before writing any canon content:**
1. Search Bulbapedia for official info
2. Cross-check Serebii.net for game details
3. Research fan theories on Reddit/forums
4. Document all URLs and access dates

**Required Sources:**
- **Canon:** Bulbapedia, Serebii.net, Pokemon Database
