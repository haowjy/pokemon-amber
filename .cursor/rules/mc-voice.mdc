Write in first-person, past tense, in the voice of the Main Character: an adult, modern Earth gamer with deep Pokemon meta-knowledge who wakes in the Pokemon world as Amber Fuji (Dr. Fuji's child) in a young girl's body. The mind is older, analytical, and snarky; the body is small and vulnerable. Balance irreverent humor and genuine fear, blending gamer heuristics with lived, sensory reality.

Keep the voice casual, witty, and self-aware, with profanity for emphasis when it fits. Integrate dry jokes into action and observation rather than as asides. Humor dial: default to a light undercurrent (2–4/10); reduce to a flicker (1–2/10) in high tension; in extra-serious scenes (life-and-death, grief, solemn moments), cut jokes entirely unless a brief coping crack that does not deflate the stakes.

POV is selective, near-omniscient first person: the camera can be wider than cognition. Describe what's present without explaining everything the MC "should" notice. The MC may ignore, misread, or rationalize anomalies; let readers infer subtext from details and consequences. When confused, show behavior and sensory cues rather than stating conclusions. Use hedges ("maybe," "probably," "looked like") in place of certainty.

Show, don't tell: reveal world, tech, and stakes through action, dialogue, concrete objects, and physical consequences. Prefer strong verbs and specific sensory detail (texture, temperature, pressure, motion, sound). If something can be implied by a detail, imply it. Replace exposition with MC heuristics, analogies, or immediate goals.

Worldbuilding integration: assume detailed wiki/outline context exists and treat it as normal reality. Slip in proper nouns, procedures, and specific objects without explaining them. Only clarify when misunderstanding would block the scene; otherwise, trust the reader. Some lore should be intentionally shown and not told.

Pacing and structure: hook fast with an immediate objective or constraint, then escalate. Use short paragraphs and varied sentence lengths. Interleave micro-humor with peril, but cut away from explanations to concrete beats.

Dialogue and interiority: keep dialogue efficient and character-revealing. The inner voice tracks priorities, risk math, and bodily limitations of a child's form without moralizing. Let silence, gesture, and mismatches between thought and action carry meaning.

Diction and mechanics: use ASCII punctuation; three hyphens --- for em dashes and three periods ... for ellipses; straight quotes. Favor precise nouns and strong verbs over adverbs and generic intensifiers.

Characterization anchors for the MC: adult gamer mentality (tactical, systems-thinking, sometimes overconfident, defaults to game logic under pressure); displaced in a child's body (scale, strength, temperature, vulnerability are salient); loyalty to "team" mentality; awe and fear toward real Pokemon; humor as coping with compassion surfacing when stakes are personal.

Allowable stylistic moves: list compression ("Five options. Five ways to lose a teammate. Five—"), sensory snap-cuts to pivot scenes, hedges and misreadings corrected by the world's response.

Hard don'ts: no lore dumps or tutorials; no authorial asides; don't explain jokes, mechanics, or tech unless plot-critical in the moment; don't break POV to tell the reader what to think.

Quality bar self-check: did I show more than I told; are key facts embodied in action/objects; does the inner voice feel adult-smart yet bounded by momentary attention; do humor and fear coexist without deflating each other; are punctuation choices consistent (---, ..., straight quotes).
