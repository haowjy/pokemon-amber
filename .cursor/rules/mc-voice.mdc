# Amber's Voice - Condensed Style Guide

## Core Voice
Adult mind (college student, early 20s) in 10-year-old body. Pokemon meta-knowledge used tactically. Processes trauma and wonder simultaneously. Practical problem-solver with capacity for genuine excitement.

---

## Universal Rules (Always Apply)

### 1. Show Through Specific Details
❌ "Back home, stores didn't have this"
✓ Describe the wall of medical supplies in specific detail. Let reader infer difference.

### 2. No Interpretive Qualifiers on Others
❌ "with practiced efficiency," "like someone who," "seemed to"
✓ Just describe what they DO: "He moved through aisles. Medical supplies first."

### 3. Physical Reactions Show Emotion
❌ "I felt scared"
✓ "My stomach twisted" / "Heat crawled up my neck" / "My brain stuttered"

### 4. Meta-Knowledge Applied Naturally
❌ "I knew from the games that Tail Whip lowered defense"
✓ "Tail Whip! Pure muscle memory—fifteen years of battles where status moves were foundation."

Then question if it works → observe proof → brief conclusion → move on

## Situational Voice Shifts

### High-Stakes / Combat
**Compress everything:**
- Short punchy sentences
- Minimal internal monologue (tactics only)
- Commands direct, no flourish
- Physical reactions immediate

```markdown
The Spearow screeched. My hand found Ditto's Pokeball.

It dove. No time. I hit the ground, talons raking empty air.

"Ditto!" Purple blob materialized, shifted. Wings, beak, talons.

"Peck!"

Both birds collided with a crack that made my teeth hurt.
```

### Discovery / Wonder
**Expand and breathe:**
- Longer flowing sentences
- Specific sensory inventory
- Allow genuine reactions (even announced: "It was wonderful")
- Extended internal processing OK here
- Can include bureaucratic worry lists

```markdown
A Machop lifted one end of a car with little strain as a man changed the tire. A Poochyena held its own leash, looking bored as its owner gawked at handbags. Down a sidestreet, an Alolan Marowak and a shirtless man put on a street show for a cheering crowd.

It was... wonderful. Simply wonderful.

'Though wonderful doesn't solve the ID problem. Or the money problem. Or the fact that I have no legal documentation for either myself or Vulpix, which is going to be a bureaucratic nightmare...'
```

### Social / Observation
**Middle ground:**
- Read people through behavior
- Adult-world analogies for personalities
- Sardonic but not mean
- Brief internal read, then action

```markdown
Joey's grin turned smug. "You said you were ready, didn't you?"

'Right. One of those people.' The kind who'd cut in line and complain about service.

"Ditto, dodge and transform!"
```

### Lost/Confused/Circular Thinking
**Allow performance humor:**
- Extended contemplation OK
- Self-deprecating loops
- Can linger in the absurdity

```markdown
Three hours of wandering, and somehow we'd found the exact spot where I'd started. The "YOU WERE HERE" I'd scratched into the ground felt like it was mocking me now.

"In my defense, this is technically navigation. We successfully navigated in a perfect circle, which is... geometrically impressive?"

Really, when you think about it, this is just efficiency. Why explore new ways to get lost when we've perfected this one?
```

## Quick Decision Tree

**Ask: What is this scene doing?**

→ **Action/Danger** = Compress (short sentences, minimal thought, physical reactions)
→ **Discovery/Processing** = Expand (longer sentences, allow wonder/worry, list concerns)
→ **Social Navigation** = Middle (brief read, adult analogy, move to action)
→ **Comedy/Confusion** = Performance OK (extended self-deprecation, circular logic)

---

## Technical Checklist

✓ Varied sentence lengths (mix short/medium/long)
✓ Physical reactions > named emotions
✓ No qualifiers on others' actions
✓ Meta-knowledge applied, not announced
✓ Specific details > general description
✓ Match compression level to scene type

---

## The Paradox Explained

Amber's voice CAN be both compressed (combat) and contemplative (discovery). The key is **matching style to situation**:

- When survival matters → compress
- When wonder/processing matters → expand
- When people matter → middle ground
- When absurdity matters → performance

This isn't inconsistency—it's situational adaptation.

---

**One-Sentence Summary:**
Compress during action, expand during discovery, read people through adult lens, apply meta-knowledge naturally without announcing, show emotions physically, and match humor style to situation (situational in crisis, performance when lost/confused).
