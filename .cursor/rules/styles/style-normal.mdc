# Normal Voice (Default Baseline)

How to write Amber's everyday voice based on the user's existing style.

## Core: Adult Mind / Child Body Split

This split is ALWAYS visible in her narration.

**Example from their writing (Chapter 14):**
```markdown
I drizzled a modest amount over my pancake at first—the responsible adult portion my brain suggested was appropriate.

But something about the warm, golden scent rising from the plate stirred a craving I couldn't ignore. Before I knew it, I was tipping the bottle again, watching amber liquid pool in the divots of the pancake.

[...]

I blinked at my creation—a sugar swamp that my college-self would have dismissed as disgusting.

But when I took that first bite, the sweetness hit my taste buds like a revelation. My adult mind registered it as overwhelmingly saccharine, but my body responded with pure delight.
```

Adult perspective constantly comments on what child body does/wants.

## How the User Does Humor

### 1. Self-Deprecating Observation (Not Self-Pity)

Narrate failures with wry distance, like a nature documentary.

**Example from their writing (Chapter 8):**
```markdown
When she finally pulled up the video, I got to experience one of yesterday's greatest hits: starring me, the world's least subtle intruder. It was still jarring to see myself—this smaller anime-haired version that my brain refused to fully accept as 'me'—wandering into the greenhouse with all the situational awareness of a Psyduck.
```

Humor is in the GAP: fancy phrasing ("yesterday's greatest hits") vs pathetic reality.

### 2. Absurdist Juxtaposition

Treat ridiculous things seriously or serious things ridiculously.

**Example from their writing (Chapter 9):**
```markdown
Moments after Kayla's departure, Erika's hip erupted in a sound somewhere between a distressed Magnemite and a fax machine having an existential crisis.
```

Overwrought description (fax machine existential crisis) for mundane object (pager).

### 3. Deadpan Escalation → Deflation

Build paranoia/intensity, then puncture with mundane reality.

**Example from their writing (Chapter 9):**
```markdown
'Does it know? Can it smell the dimensional stink on me, like some kind of cosmic TSA agent?'

The Meowth swiveled and repeated the gesture to a passing couple arguing over a map.

Oh. It's just an asshole.
```

Escalates → deflates. Delivered completely straight.

### 4. Specific Detail When It Serves the Joke

Sometimes a specific reference lands funnier than a vague one.

**Example from their writing (Chapter 9):**
```markdown
Kayla had dozed off twice during our planning session, her chin dipping toward her chest in that slow-motion surrender every college student learns before their first 8 AM midterm.
```

"8 AM midterm" is funnier than just "tired" because it's relatable and specific. But don't force specificity everywhere.

### Humor Guidelines:
- Never announce the joke ("This was hilarious")
- Deliver completely straight
- The gap IS the joke (fancy phrasing vs reality, adult POV vs kid context)
- Escalate then deflate
- Specific details when they serve the joke
- Understate after drama
- Self-aware but not self-pitying

## Other Elements

**Pop culture comparisons:** Modern references slip in naturally (Big Apple, TSA agents, college experiences).

**Processing through metaphor:** Pokemon world understood through comparisons (Glaceon warmth, fax machine crisis, Psyduck awareness).

**Quick social reads:** Fast assessments with adult cynicism, often wrong, quick pivots.

**Genuine enthusiasm breaks through:** Real excitement about Pokemon cuts through the irony.

**Understated emotions:** Show impact, don't name feelings ("hit harder than it should have" not "I felt sad").

**Ambient detail collection:** Ground scenes through accumulated small observations (crayon drawings, height marks, clock watching).

## How to Write Normal Voice

**Sentence variety:** Mix all lengths naturally—short punchy, medium with clauses, long flowing.

**Internal dialogue:** Use multiple formats—italicized thoughts, narrative questioning, direct observation. Don't always flag "I thought."

**Body awareness:** Note being 10 casually (world feels adult-sized, people patronize). NOT toddler height (standard doors/sinks/counters are reachable).

## What to Aim For

When writing Amber's normal voice:
- Keep adult/child split constantly visible
- Use humor through juxtaposition and gaps
- Drop old-world references naturally
- Make quick cynical social reads
- Let genuine enthusiasm break through irony
- Mix all sentence lengths fluidly
- Understate emotional reactions
- Balance contradictions simultaneously (cynicism/wonder, observation/participation)
