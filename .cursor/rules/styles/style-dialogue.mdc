## The User's Dialogue Style

### Characters Speak From Their State

People speak from emotion/mental state, not to explain things to reader.

**Example from their writing (Chapter 12):**
```markdown
"Hey." Dr. Fuji's voice broke as he stepped onto the path. "We need to talk about Delia."

Stephen stopped, briefcase shifting in his grip. His expression was guarded, but not yet afraid.

"Dr. Fuji." He spoke like someone approaching a wounded Pokemon. "What you're doing with that child... Delia told me everything about Amber. About what happened. I understand what you went through, butâ€”"

"Understand?" The word tasted like acid. "You understand?"
```

Fuji interrupts because he's spiraling (not for plot). Stephen speaks carefully because he's scared.

### Physical Action Speaks Alongside Words

What characters DO while talking often says more than the words.

**Example from their writing (Chapter 2):**
```markdown
"Do you have dresses? Ideally a white dress?" he called toward the counter. "For a child?"

The girl's head lifted slowly from her magazine. She stared at him, then glanced around at the racks of tourist tees and cheap flip-flops. At the energy drinks. At the industrial bags of chips.

"Sir, this is a convenience store," her voice flat.

Dr. Fuji's jaw tightened. He turned back to the rack, pulling out the yellow Psyduck shirt with more force than necessary.
```

Her slow scan speaks volumes. His grip shows frustration.

### Real Speech = Messy

People interrupt, trail off, restart, use fragments.

**Example from their writing (Chapter 14):**
```markdown
"But Mo-om," Ash dragged out the word. "It's Clair's Blastoise!"

"Homework," Delia repeated, finally stepping fully into the room. Her eyes flicked briefly to me, then away. "There will probably be reruns later."

Ash slumped dramatically. "Fine," he grumbled, but made no move to get up. "Who's your favorite trainer?" he asked me, lowering his voice as if Delia might not hear him from six feet away.

"Ash." Just his name this time, but with a warning tone that made him sigh loudly.
```

Natural interruptions, tone carries meaning, kids push boundaries.

## How to Write Dialogue

**Use action beats more than tags:** Show who's speaking through what they're doing, not through "said."

**Amber's two voices:**
- Internal: Sarcastic, adult references, self-deprecating ("cosmic TSA agent")
- External: Careful, kid-appropriate, asks permission ("Um, would it be okay if...")

**Kids sound like kids:** Exclamations, taunts, physical reactions while talking, exaggerated comparisons.

**Match age and state:** A spiraling scientist speaks differently than a tired clerk speaks differently than an excited kid.

## What to Aim For

When writing dialogue for this story:
- Show character state through HOW they speak
- Ground conversation in physical action
- Use fragments, interruptions, trailing off naturally
- Keep Amber's internal/external voice split
- Match speech to age and mental state
- Use silence and non-response as communication
- Ground conversations in physical space (not talking heads)
