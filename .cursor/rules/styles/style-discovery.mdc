# Discovery & Exploration

How to write discovery/exploration scenes based on the user's existing style.

## The User's Discovery Style

### Game Knowledge Meets Reality Gaps

Amber constantly compares what she sees to game mechanics, then processes the gaps.

**Example from their writing (Chapter 7):**
```markdown
The bulletin board loomed before me, a maze of paper and possibility that made my knowledge of the pokemon games suddenly feel inadequate. "A... job board?" I muttered, caught between fascination and confusion. The papers pinned to cork seemed almost archaic compared to the Center's otherwise modern aesthetic. It almost seemed like the job boards for the mystery dungeon games... but that wasn't a game with any humans in it, besides the protagonist.
```

She expects game logic, finds real-world complexity, notes the gap.

### Adult Aesthetic Observations

Architecture, design, materials get noticed through adult lens.

**Example from their writing (Chapter 5):**
```markdown
The building ahead grew more imposing with each step, glass and steel rising up behind the ancient trees in a way that should have felt jarring but somehow worked. Like the games evolving from pixel art to modern graphics, there was something satisfying about the progression from natural to modern, from the Ginkgo arcade to the sleek facility beyond.
```

Design appreciation a child wouldn't articulate.

### Sensory Inventory Through Specific Details

Ground discoveries through texture, material, temperature, small physical details.

**Example from their writing (Chapter 7):**
```markdown
The text along the top read "CELADON METRO" in bright blue letters, with "24-HOUR PASS" printed below in smaller type. The card itself had that peculiar well-worn flexibility of polyester, already slightly curved from being stored in stacks. Something about its mundane imperfection was oddly comforting—like finding a familiar book in a foreign library.
```

The specific detail (polyester flexibility, curved from storage) grounds the moment.

### Cross-World Comparisons Slip In

Old-world references appear naturally in her observations.

**Example from their writing (Chapter 7):**
```markdown
I wasn't from a big city, but I had been to the Big Apple a few times, where they had exactly this kind of card. The memory felt strange now—like remembering a movie I'd watched rather than a life I'd lived.
```

References her past life without announcing it awkwardly.

### Wonder Mixed With Practical Worry

Awe and anxiety coexist—she never just marvels without also calculating.

**Example from their writing (Chapter 7):**
```markdown
The escalator deposited me into the Pokemon Center's main lobby. I had to stop myself from gasping audibly. The familiar game sprite had done nothing to prepare me for the sheer scale of it all.
```

Followed immediately by practical assessment of the three lobby sections.

### Tourist Self-Awareness

She knows she looks out of place and comments on it.

**Example from their writing (Chapter 7):**
```markdown
I reached for one of the sheets before catching myself, suddenly aware of how out of place I must look. Around me, trainers moved with the easy confidence of people who'd done this a thousand times, scanning notices and occasionally plucking papers free with practiced motions. Meanwhile, I stood frozen like a tourist at a museum.
```

Self-conscious but pushes through anyway.

## How to Write Discovery Scenes

**Sentence flow:** Use longer, flowing sentences with multiple clauses. Create breathing room for taking things in.

**Physical limitations:** Highlight child body through environment (high door handles, turnstile struggles, can't reach things).

**Beauty hiding danger:**
```markdown
The trees' shadows suddenly felt less majestic and more like convenient hiding spots for things that smiled too widely.
```

Unease builds through atmosphere, not announcement.

**Accumulate details:** Build atmosphere through collected small observations rather than big sweeping descriptions.

## What to Aim For

When writing discovery/exploration for this story:
- Compare game expectations to reality gaps
- Use longer, breathing sentences  
- Show adult aesthetic appreciation
- Reference old world naturally
- Oscillate between wonder and worry
- Acknowledge tourist/outsider status
- Ground through mundane physical details
- Build atmosphere through accumulation
