# Battle Scenes

How to write battle scenes based on the user's existing style.

---

## Before Writing

Map out:
1. **Choreography** - Where is everyone? How does positioning change?
2. **Motivations** - What does each character want RIGHT NOW?
3. **Strategy** - Why these moves? What's the counter?

## The User's Battle Style

### Tactical Clarity Through Context

The reader understands tactics from situation + result, not from commands explaining things.

**Example from their writing (Chapter 16):**
```markdown
"Arcanine, Extreme Speed! Tank it if you must!" Oak's voice cut through Fuji's cries.

The instant the canine's paws struck the ground, it became a blur of orange and black. A sharp crack accompanied the blur as it tore through the air.

Before Magmar could fully aim its attack, Arcanine slammed into its side. The impact threw Magmar off balance, its would-be Flamethrower erupting harmlessly into the night sky, a brief, angry star against the darkness.
```

Oak's talking to Arcanine. We infer the tactic (interrupt Magmar's charge-up) from context.

### Strategic Layering

Professional battles have attack → counter → counter-counter sequences.

**Example from their writing (Chapter 16):**
```markdown
Fuji, caught by surprise by Oak's sudden attacks, roared a counter-command. "Quick, Flamethrower!"

But before it could flamethrower, Oak quietly smirked and countered the counter, "Exeggutor, Light Screen for Tauros!"

[...] Oak did not panic. He let Tauros charge straight through the fire; its broad, muscled shoulders absorbed the searing heat, the dense hide sizzling as it pressed through the flames.
```

Tauros takes damage but completes objective. The plan accounts for taking hits.

### Amber POV = Internal Commentary Continues

When Amber fights, she doesn't compress her thoughts—she processes alongside action.

**Example from their writing (Chapter 4):**
```markdown
"Tail Whip!" I called out, immediately tense about my choice. It was pure muscle memory—fifteen years of Pokemon battles where status moves were foundation. In the games, it had been simple math: lower defense, increase damage output, victory. But now, watching Ditto face down a very real Rattata with very real teeth, I found myself questioning years of virtual combat experience. Would a tail swish actually make physical attacks hurt more here?

Ditto spun with a fluid grace that caught me off-guard. Joey's Rattata tracked the motion, whiskers twitching rapidly, and when it settled back into its fighting stance, its movements carried a new hesitation.

'Huh,' I thought, watching the subtle shift. 'So that's what a status move looks like in real life.'
```

She questions game mechanics MID-BATTLE. Her adult analytical voice stays active.

## How to Write Combat Scenes

**Sentence structure:** Use longer, clause-dense sentences when needed for clarity. Don't compress for the sake of speed.

**Emotional states drive tactics:** Show why characters call moves through their mental state, not just strategy.

**Environmental consequences:** Attacks affect the space—fire spreads, floors crack, houses burn.

**Spatial tracking:** With multiple combatants, use clear position markers ("on the other side of the battlefield").

**Differentiate skill levels:** Amateur battles = reactive, mistakes, learning. Professional = layered strategy, coordination, environmental mastery.

## What to Aim For

When writing combat for this story:
- Make choreography and positioning clear
- Show tactical intent through context and results
- Continue internal commentary for Amber POV
- Use longer sentences when clarity needs it
- Let emotion and character state drive move choices
- Track consequences beyond just damage
- Ground action in physical space
