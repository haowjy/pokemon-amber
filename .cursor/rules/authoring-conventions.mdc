# Authoring Conventions (Filenames + YAML Front Matter)

## Filenaming
- Official, reader-facing content: no leading underscores
  - Examples: `story/chapter1/chapter1.md`, `wiki/chapters.md`, `wiki/events/pallet_attack.md`
- Author notes/unofficial/drafts: begin with an underscore `_`
  - Examples: `story/chapter1/_notes.md`, `story/chapter1/_characters.md`, `wiki/_drafts/_migration-plan.md`
- This convention applies to both `story/` and `wiki/` (and anywhere else we keep writing).

## YAML Front Matter (required)
All authoring files (story, wiki, notes) should start with YAML front matter. Schemas below are recommended; add fields as needed.

### Story chapter (reader-facing)
```yaml
---
title: "[Chapter 1] Truck-kun Strikes Again"
chapter: 1
arc: cinnabar
pov: Amber Fuji
status: draft # or published
hidden: false # true for withheld/unpublished content
created: 2025-09-20
updated: 2025-09-20
---
```

### Chapter-local notes (author/internal)
```yaml
---
type: note
scope: chapter
chapter: 1
spoilers: true
status: draft
hidden: true
created: 2025-09-20
updated: 2025-09-20
tags: [intent, foreshadowing]
---
```

### Arc notes (author/internal)
```yaml
---
type: note
scope: arc
arc_id: arc01-celadon
chapters: [7, 8, 9, 10]
spoilers: true
status: draft
hidden: true
updated: 2025-09-20
---
```

### Global notes (author/internal)
```yaml
---
type: note
scope: global
category: worldbuilding # or continuity, themes, mechanics
spoilers: false
status: draft
hidden: true
updated: 2025-09-20
---
```

### Wiki pages (reader-facing reference)
```yaml
---
type: wiki
category: events # or chapters, index
title: Pallet Town Attack
requires_citations: true
status: published
updated: 2025-09-20
---
```

## Hidden content
- Use `hidden: true` on any file we donâ€™t want surfaced or exported.
- Notes default to `hidden: true`. Story/wiki defaults to `hidden: false` unless intentionally withheld.

## Notes
- Keep official prose and public wiki clean (no inline author commentary).
- Add/adjust fields as our process evolves; prefer consistency across files.
