## Punctuation Conventions

- Em dash: use three hyphens `---` in source.
  - Rationale: easy to type consistently across editors; renderers/styles can convert to a typographic em dash.
- Ellipsis: use three periods `...` (avoid unicode ellipsis for consistency).
- Quotes: plain ASCII quotes `"` `'` are fine; avoid curly quotes in source.
- Hyphenation vs dashes:
  - Hyphen `-` for compound words (e.g., 8-bit).
  - En/Em dash as `---` for breaks or asides in sentences.

## Spelling and Terms

- Pokemon words: choose one and stay consistent within a file.
  - `Pokemon` (ASCII) is acceptable; `Pokemon` (accented) is also acceptable.
- Game-era terms: prefer `8-bit`, `3D`, `Pokéstop`/`Pokestop` consistently within a file.

## Front Matter

- All authoring files include YAML front matter per `authoring-conventions.mdc`.
- Update the `updated:` date when making substantive edits.
