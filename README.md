## About This Project

This repository is an experiment in **AI-assisted creative writing**. The story is written collaboratively using LLMs (primarily Claude) as a writing partner—helping with:

- Drafting and refining prose
- Maintaining consistency across chapters
- World-building and lore documentation
- Style guidelines and voice consistency
- Story structure and pacing feedback

The `.cursor/rules/` directory contains custom prompts and style guides that help the AI understand the story's voice, tone, and conventions. The `wiki/` serves as a shared knowledge base for both human and AI to reference.

**Goal:** Explore how AI can augment creative writing without replacing the human author's vision and decision-making.

### File Naming Conventions

- **Official content:** No leading underscore (e.g., `chapter1.md`, `amber-mc.md`)
- **Author notes/drafts:** Leading underscore. Chapter-local files are numbered to match the folder:
  - `_Xnotes.md`, `_Xsummary.md` (e.g., `_10notes.md`, `_10summary.md`)
  - Rationale: improves clarity and sorting when many chapter folders are open.

All authoring files include YAML front matter with metadata (title, status, dates, etc.).

## About the World

This story draws from multiple Pokemon canons:
- **Anime** (primary): Mewtwo origin, Dr. Fuji backstory, world aesthetics
- **Games** (secondary): Mechanics, locations, some lore
- **Manga** (tertiary): Character depth, darker themes
- **Fan theories**: Integrated where they enhance the story

The world is grounded and lived-in: Pokemon work at train stations, battles are chaotic and real-time, and the consequences of playing god with genetics don't reset when you close the cartridge.
